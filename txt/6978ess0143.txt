			 Now I have reached 60 and working part time I'm glad to have more time for my main interests which is making music. I have played in various bands over the years covering most genres in popular music. I'm enjoying socializing with family and friends and going to concerts and shows etc. Although my health has suffered especially in my later years having contracted polio at 18 month of age, I'm lucky that most of my hobbies are not to energetic and am still able to go freshwater fishing with my son and friends. I enjoy being at home and especially spending time working and relaxing in the garden. Now things are a little easier financiallly. I enjoy spoiling my family and am able to have regular holidays abroad.
