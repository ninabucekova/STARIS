			 I hope at 60 I will still be fit enough to walk miles, go fellwalking & that my husband will also be well as we have this pleasure. I hope my joints will not be any more arthritic & I will be able to continue playing the piano & violin. I hope I'll still be teaching the piano & doing voluntary counselling work in other words I'd like to still be leading the sort of life I have now. I will be quite happy if my children need to live at home so long as their lives are fulfilled. I hope they have'nt moved too far away.

I hope the old lady I UNCLEAR will still be alive & well I hope y Mum and UNCLEAR will also be well & content.
