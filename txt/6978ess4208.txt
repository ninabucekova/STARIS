				 National Child Development Study: Sweep 8, 2008-2009 
		 
			 In 10 years time I would expect my parents to have died. My children will be in their twenties and should have completed university and be self supporting. I would expect my husband to have retired from mainstream work. My husband and I are currently in good health and there is no reason to believe that there should be any significant deterioration on the next 10 years. So, aged 60, I should have time to spend with my husband, travelling, enjoying outdoor pursuits such as hiking and skiing, and visiting theatres and attending concerts. I might also take up some new academic study.
