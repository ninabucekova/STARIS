			 RETIRED FROM CITY JOB AT 55 - WORKING LOCALLY SOMEWHAT POORER THAN BEFORE BUT LESS STRESSED!! ENJOYING WATCHING MY SON GROW UP AS A BRILLIANT FOOTBALLER AND MUSICIAN - ENGLAND & STARDOM AWAIT. HOPEFULLY STILL IN GOOD HEALTH - EATING & DRINKING A LOT LESS THAN DURING MY CITY DAYS - WALKING MORE AND DOING LOADS OF GARDENING. PLAYING IN A GERIATRIC ROCK AND ROLL BAND IF ARTHRITIS HAS NOT GOT THE BETTER OF MY FINGERS. INVOLVED IN THE THINGS MY SON DOES - LIKELY GOVERNOR OF SCHOOL, MAYBE RUNNING HIS FOOTBALL TEAM, TAKING HIS TO AND FROM WHATEVER HIS ACTIVITIES ARE AND GENERALLY TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH A FOUTEEN YEAR OLD! STILL WAITING FOR PINK FLOYD REUNION (UNLIKELY!)
