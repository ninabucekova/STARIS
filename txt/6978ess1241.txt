			 Ten years ago, I anticipated that, at this point, I'd be settling into a nice early retirement! Oh how wrong could I have been !? The last ten years have seen hundreds of thousands wiped off my savings and it now looks like I'll have to work until 70! If only as a consultant. On the upside, my health is great I'm fitter than I have been for 15 years. My home life is as good now as 10 years ago and I have a wonderful family life. All in all, nothing to complain about - apart from not having quite the freedom I wanted but at least the UK is sorting itself out, finally.
