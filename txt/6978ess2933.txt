			 Home life is good as my wife and I do more together, and are more at ease with each others foibles. My wife and I are more able to spend time on shared interests:- Travel - bird watching. Not worrying about health in general - older relatives past & present active & independent - But some potential geneticly inherent condition could be looming? Feeling emotionally well with knowledge of children independent & settled and Grandchildren to brighten life further. Looking forward to semi retirement till hopefully seventy - giving more leisure time.
