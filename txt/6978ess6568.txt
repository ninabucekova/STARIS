			 I Expect to still be working and be healthy. I may have moved to working independantly but expect to still be in {PLACE Scotland}. My home life will no longer include my youngest daughter but there is a chance we will work together. My Elder daugther may be married to a person of another race and I would expect I would have more grandchildren from this union. My eldest Child - Son - will still be working on a self employed basis and in his current relationship. I expect my youngest child will be between relationships with perhaps one child.
