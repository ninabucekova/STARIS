			 GOING FOR WALKS WITH MY WIFE; VISITING OUR CHILDREN & POSSIBLY GRAND CHILDREN VISITING FRIENDS / HAVING FRIENDS OVER. SPARE TIME ON MY LATHE OR PAINTING OR SCULPTING etc RELAXING HOLIDAYS ON OUR OWN. I DON'T REALLY WANT TO BE WORKING MUCH AFTER 60y OLD. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH MY WIFE & FAMILY IN THE FEW SHORT YEARS THAT MY MOBILILTY MAY LAST. THIS IS NOT A FATALISTIC VIEW - THE LAST 50 YEARS  HAVE FLOWN BY & THEY SEEM TO BE GETTING QUICKER, IT'S USUALY CHRISTMAS BY THE TIME IT SHOULD BE EASTER! SO IF WE LIVE ANOTHER 10 OR 20 OR EVEN 30 YEARS. HOW QUICK WILL THEY GO! I JUST THINK IT IS SO SAD & SUCH A WASTE TO WORK UP UNTIL YOUR DEATH!
