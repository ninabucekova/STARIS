			 Although I cannot afford to retire & live on my state pension I am really pleased to be able to continue to contribute by sharing my knowledge & passing it onto others. When I was younger I would never have imagined the developmental curve I would enter in my 40's & 50's, bringing together my creative interests ie art, music, comedy & drama with my professional work with young people. I am amazed at how my songwriting is embedded in my life & that I have the opportunity to perform & play with other musicians, travel & meet many new people . . . and spend some time with the grandchildren!
