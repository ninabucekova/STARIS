			 LIFE AT 60 IS A MUCH SLOWER PACE AND PEACEFUL, AS MY CHILDREN HAVE LEFT HOME, LEAVING MORE TIME FOR MY HUSBAND AND I TO DO WHAT WE WANT AT ANY TIME. MORE HOLIDAYS AND WEEKEND BREAKS AS WE HAVE MORE MONEY TO SPEND ON OURSELVES. THIS WAY OF LIFE MAKES ME FEEL CALMER AND RELAXED. MY GENERAL HEALTH IS GOOD APART FROM A FEW ACHES AND PAINS DUE TO GETTING OLDER. HAVING GRANDCHILDREN TO LOOK AFTER KEEPS ME MENTALLY ALERT AND FEELING YOUNG AND FEEL THAT SOMETIMES THIS IS AN UNPAID JOB.
