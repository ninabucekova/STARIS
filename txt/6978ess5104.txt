			 My two children will have settled into jobs they want, having done well at school. I will no longer be working, and will be travelling to many places in the world with my wife. Both of us will finally be able to pursue our joint interests of painting. Most importantly in that we have a wide circle of friends to enjoy our recreational time with. I suspect that my health may have deteriorated regarding joints/flexability I hope this will not impact on our hopes of walking holiday. Although not rich, with some careful budgeting we should be able to have a fairly comfortable life and do the things we want.
