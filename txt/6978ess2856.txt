			 I think I shall probably have my friends that I have now. I will visit them and they me, talk on the phone a lot. I will be visiting my family as often as I can, doing all I can for my children. I think I shall still be working, probably in the same place. Apart from the usual aches and pains, I hope to be quite fit for my age.
