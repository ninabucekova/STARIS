			 I'M NOW RETIRED, BUT I HELP OUT VOLANTARILY AT A HOSPICE I GET ALOT OF FULFILMENT KNOWING I AM HELPING OTHERS WHO ARE TERMINALLY ILL. I HAVE MORE TIME FOR MY GRANDCHILDREN AND TIME NOW TO READ A BOOK AND TO OR SHOULD I SAY WRITE ABOUT MY LIFE AND MAYBE IT COULD BECOME A BOOK FOR OTHERS TO READ!! I STILL LIKE WALKING, LAUGHING, TALKING AND A GLASS OR 2 OF WINE! I MAY BE 60 BUT I FEEL 30 EVEN THROUGH MY BODY DOESN'T LOOK 30 BUT I DON'T CARE I'M STILL YOUNG AT HEART AND HOW I FEEL IS THE MOST IMPORTANT. MONEY DOESN'T BRING YOU HAPPINESS YOUR HEALTH IS MORE IMPORTANT. AND MY GRANDCHILDREN ARE SO IMPORTANT AND CHILDREN TO ME.
