			 WELL HAVING JUST TURNED 50, I AM PRETTY MUCH SURE I'LL SEE SIMILAR DAY TO DAY ACTIVITIES AND CHALLENGES, AS SOME SORT OF ROUTINE IS MY STYLE OF LIFE, APART FROM THE OBVIOUS, MORE GREY, WRINKLES, ACHES, I WILL BE ASPIRING TO KEEP HEALTHY WITH WORKOUT, GOOD DIET, AND HAPPINESS, THROUGH MY FAMILY. IN RELATION TO FAMILY I ALSO EXPECT TO BECOME A GRANDPARENT AS WELL, BY THEN MY KID'S WILL BE 36 AND 34 RESPECTIVELY, SO THAT WILL BE A GREAT MOVE FORWARD AND SOMETHING (GOD WILLING) - I STRONGLY LOOK FORWARD TO, JUST FOR THE CHANCE TO INSTILL SOME OF MY GOODNESS IN THEM. GETTING OLD FOR ME IS NOT A BARRIER, BECAUSE I HAVE A GOOD OUTLOOK ON LIFE I AM TOTALLY CONFIDENT IN ALL I DO, ALSO IN VINTAGE IT GET'S MATURE AND BETTER THAT'S MY TAKE IN LIFE. GOD WILLING I VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO IT ALL. (HOPE THIS IS OF SOME - HELP -) THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING. PERSONAL
