			 I am retired but still involved in number of working activities providing advise to schools, charities etc. Probably doing some property consultancy still. I will be doing some physical activities - more gardening and dog walking. Hopefully my health will be improving rather than deteriorating as my lifestyle sill be more healthy than now during my working life. My children will be grown up and much of time will be taken up UNCLEAR and helping with grand children. Hopefully my life will have more choice and flexibility - ie I will work when I wan to and feel that I am in control of my destiny.
