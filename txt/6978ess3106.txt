			 I am still married to {HUSBAND}, who is about to retire. We are looking at a motorhome with a view to buying one and touring Europe, visiting friends who have retired to France. We visit our 3 daughters regularly, and enjoy time with our grandchildren. We are wondering about downsizing, but enjoy our garden too much. I have had a knee replacement, which is making life easier, and I still attend the local gym. I still feel I am putting lots of weight on, but my husband still seems to love me. I still enjoy reading and have recently begun painting again. Life is good!
