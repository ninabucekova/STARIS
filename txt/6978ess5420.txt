			 Since reducing my working hours I now have more time to spend at home. Somewhat ironically my daughter, now 18, spends more time with her friends. But she is about to go to university and leads a busy life, so this is as it should be. I have become more involved in village life, helping out on a couple of committees. Work is still important. I still enjoy going on to the office, although working from home is the norm. I now have two dogs. Something I used to dream of. We enjoy going away on holiday a couple of times a year but I look forward to retirement when we can spend more time travelling further afield.
