			 At 60, I hope and plan to still be happily married, though beginning to enjoy more of the benefits of our children having grown up and left home. I expect to still be working hard in a Management role, remaining creative and a source of ideas and inspiration. Currently I am a church trustee/director, and a school Governor - I anticipte the governor role will end as my sons are no longer in education, but may persist on an appointed basis ending before I reach 60. I hope we'll be close to paying off the mortgage.
