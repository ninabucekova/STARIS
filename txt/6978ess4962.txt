			 I live a simple life. I enjoy my job and the people I meet there. My spare time revolves around my labrador - walking in the countryside as much as I can. At weekends I meet up with family / friends which involves a nice meal either in a pub/restaurant or in someones home. Again walking takes up a big chunk of the weekend. My health is generally good and I consider myself fitter than most other people my age. I like to take a couple of holidays a year. I visit Austria nearly every year walking, and I also like a beach holiday to rest and unwind - the Caribbean is a favourite destination. Working in a local supermarket I meet many people in any one day and have formed many lasting friendships in this regard I consider myself very fortunate.
