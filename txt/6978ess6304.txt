			 My life, work and home, is very tied with being clergy in a rural parish. I imagined that in 10 years time it might be much the same but Im hoping it might be in a more urban setting where I can walk to local amenities eg shops, swimming, library church etc. My children will be 23 & 25 & possibly out of full time education so some more disposable income for foreign travel (at 11 I remember responding that I wanted to be air hostess possibly for the same reason!) I hope that my health should be just as good & stable as now. Interests (apart from travel) might be more photography or other art related activities, incl Theatre.
