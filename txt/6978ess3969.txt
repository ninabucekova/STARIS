			 Now I am 60 I have retired and Enjoying seeing as much of the World as possible My health is not perfect, however I can still run for a bus or fend off a mugger, I have taken a part time job at B&Q, so now I not only spend a few days a week down here without my wife asking how much longer I will be in here, but, I now get paid for spending time in B&Q talking to people about D.I.Y. The rest of my time is spent enjoying my retirement with my wife, spending time together is important, and when we have had Enough of the Grandchildren we give them back and go off for a few days. Brilliant!
