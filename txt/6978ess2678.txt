			 I feel happy about my health, having never smoked I haven't suffered some smoking related illnesses. I am no longer working, but spending more time with my daughter and her family. My husband and I are looking into moving now, something we wanted to do several yers ago. Were looking at places near {PLACE South West England} where our caravan is kept. We still meet our friends and the Clay shoot we run is now quite successful, but I wonder how long we can go on running it.
