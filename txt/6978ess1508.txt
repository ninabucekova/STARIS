			 Life at 60 - I would hope not to be working and to have more time to pursue hobbies & other interests. I suspect my health will not be as good as it is now. I would like to travel more, perhaps buy / rent a property abroad to spend part of the year in. I do however have concerns over finances once I stop work and am uncertain what my financial situation will be - not as good as it is now I imagine.
