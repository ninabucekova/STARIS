			 I hope I still have the closeness of my children and grandchildren that I have now. Also with my extended family. I like to walk and enjoy visiting places of interest. I would like to be healthy enough to do so. I have had 2 episodes of depression that could re-occur. If it does - I hope it is managable as it is at present. My husband suffers ill-health. I hope he still manages to achieve all he does at the moment. I have been at my present employment for 20 years. Although its not challenging - I would like to think that if not there I can be healthy and lucky enough to be employed.
