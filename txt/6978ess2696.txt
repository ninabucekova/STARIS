			 This question reminded me of the one we were asked at age 11 and I think I wrote about becoming an air hostess! Needless to say I did not! At 60 years old I still enjoy line dancing, do not do as much running as I did ten years ago but now cycle for pleasure with my husband. We now have more free time since I no longer work at an F.E College part-time (French). We have a small property in France and spend time over there renewing our love of the language and country. Our children have completed their university education and are both working one as a doctor. My health is quite good.
