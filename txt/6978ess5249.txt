			 Having moved back to the North West after living in London for 25 years, the pace of life seemed much slower, but I am enjoying living in a village in more of a community. I am managing to spend more time on my hobbies, golf, gardening, walking and voluntary work. I am also enjoying my part time job and at present my health is ok.
