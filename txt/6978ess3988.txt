			 I would have retired from full-time work. I would probably have a part-time job to keep me busy and help financially. Our children will have probably left home so we may have 'downsized' our house to a smaller property. Hopefully, we would have enough savings to holiday abroad for the winter months, maybe Nov-March. My wife is self employed so hopefully she would work around the winter break. The biggest cloud on the horizon is obviously our health. Hopefully, I wil be reasonably fit & healthy, but already my joints ache and I suffer with tinnitus so we'll have to see!
