			 I will probably still be working to pay off the mortgage, but I really enjoy my work so I don't see this as being a problem. My future is my children as long as they are happy I will be. I love gardening, walking the dog, DIY and sewing, so see myself doing everything that I enjoy. I'm happy by myself and am not looking for another partner. If someone turns up then I'll cross that bridge when I come to it. My happiness is the most important.
