The mortgage will be paid off. I will be involved in the local community and active in church activities.

Having worked full time all my life I will be enjoying looking after the home and garden and spending time with my husband. I will be supporting our two sons and enjoying spending time with them & their partners/families. I may be suffering from arthritis, but having treatment if need be. I am worried about my mothers health and dementia.
