			 I retired early five years ago and now work as a consultant from home on an ad hoc basis. Unless it is very lucrative I do not work more than 2 days per week. I spend my 'spare' time walking the dog, painting watercolours, taking an evening class on wine-tasting (as the lecturer) I am keeping my weight down but still need to use a CPAP machine for sleep apnoea. My knees are becoming more painful and I may need an operation soon.
