				 National Child Development Study: Sweep 8, 2008-2009 
		 
			 Now that my children are all grown I am working as a teaching assistant helping young people reach their potential. This takes up a lot of time. I am also still active in the justice and Peace group at my church. My home can feel quiet sometimes but when the children visit it comes to life. I enjoy outings with my friend {FRIEND} who is still active at 70. My own health isn't too bad, a few twinges here and there. I am still living alone, I never did meet anyone else. Sometimes I worry about paying the mortgage off but I try not to let this take over my thoughts because I'm sure all will be well in the end. I am still basically a positive person.
