			 Now I am 60 I can look back at the last 10 years and be thankful that my health has remained good overall. Since I changed my life at 50 it has been a much better and satisfying life and in myself I feel a greater sense of inner reward and achievement. Most aspects of my life are as I would wish them to be so I have contentment with where I am at 60. A few years ago I successfully changed direction in my job and that has brought great rewards. My children have found their own lifes and seem happy so I am grateful for that. I have had my canal boat for 10 years and It has brought me the peace end enlightenment I had hoped for. It has also brought happiness for all those who have shared time with me on the boat. Overall I feel I know my true self much better these days and following the death of my wife some 15 years ago I have finally found the final part of the jig saw of life a new and truely loving relationship.
