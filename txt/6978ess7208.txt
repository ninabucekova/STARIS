			 LIFE IS LESS HECTIC NOW AS OUR YOUNGEST DAUGHTER IS NOW 18. GRANDCHILDREN ARE PLENTIFUL AND BRING US LOTS OF PLEASURE. I REMAIN IN A LOVING PARTNERSHIP AND MY HEALTH REMAINS GOOD. I STILL ENJOY WATCHING FOOTBALL AND GOING FOR A BEER WITH FRIENDS. TRAVEL REMAINS IMPORTANT AND MY HEALTH DOES NOT PREVENT ME FROM GOING TO THE THEATRE, CINEMA AND EATING OUT. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO RETIREMENT AND MAYBE DOING SOMETHING OF A VOLUNTARY NATURE WITH MY SPARE TIME. I MIGHT ALSO TAKE UP GOLF A LITTLE MORE SERIOUSLY IF MY BODY ALLOWS.
