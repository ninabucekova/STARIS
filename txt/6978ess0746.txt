			 I am now 60 and have been retired from work - it feels like being in heaven!! The torment and punishing burden that I have suffered for over 30 years has melted away and my days are divided between my cottage in England and my chateau in the South of France overlooking the sea where I am able to relax - swimming in the pool, reading and listening to music. Evenings are spent with our friends and neighbours - Mick Jagger is a frequent visitor - and days are spent on the beach. My health is good and neither my partner nor I envisage working ever again!!! My face lift has been a complete success and I am indistinguishable from the 30 year olds.
