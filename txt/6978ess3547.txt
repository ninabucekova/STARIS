			 AT 60 I HOPE TO HAVE RETIRED FROM WORK AND HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY TO LIVE A BUSY LIFE. I WOULD HOPE TO HAVE GRANDCHILDREN TO LOOK AFTER AND BE ABLE TO SPEND TIME WITH MY FAMILY. I ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING OUT A BIT MORE ON MY BIKE. IF TIME ALLOWS I WOULDN'T MIND AN ALLOTMENT. SOME CHEAP OUT OF SEASON HOLIDAYS IN SPAIN WOULD BE GOOD ALSO, AND IF I HAVN'T DONE IT BY THEN I WILL TRAVEL TO WATCH THE TOUR DE FRANCE MOUNTAIN STAGES AND DO OTHER SUCH THINGS THAT TIME ALLOWS.
