			 My circumstances have changed quite a lot. I am now living with my elderly husband who requires more care. We do not travel as much as we used to but we try to visit somewhere every week. My husband enjoys listening to music & stories - audio tapes - & some funny programmes we usually see on DVD. We are living in a small bungalow in the country and our sons are mostly away from home but keep in touch and are enjoying life. I do some painting music gardening & study to fill my time and I teach private pupils at my house to supplement our income. I continue to be healthy. My husband is well, but frail & has to be careful re his diabetes. We still pursue our philosphical interests.
