			 WELL I'S STILL HERE THATS A BONUS I'M STILL WORKING HARD STILL WORKING TOO MANY HOURS & TRAVELLING A LOT. HOPEFULLY PLAYING A BIT MORE GOLF & GETTING MY HANDICAP DOWN. SPENDING MORE TIME WITH MY WIFE NOW ALL THE KIDS HAVE LEFT HOME. STILL WORRIED ABOUT RETIREMENT STARTED SAVING WAY TOO LATE - I'LL WORK UNTILL I'M 65. HEALTH STILL GOOD ALTHOUGH I WORRY ABOUT HEART DISEASE (MY DAD DIED AT 57 OF A HEART ATTACK). HOPEFULLY I'VE STOPPED TRYING TO PLEASE EVERYONE & THINK ABOUT MYSELF MORE.
