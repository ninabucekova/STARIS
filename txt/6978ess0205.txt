			 Similar to the life I lead now - Hopefully healthy fit and usually happy. Probably a lot more time in {COUNTRY Europe} in the small apartment we own. No intentions of working again since leaving job in March after 21 yrs, but never say never. Will downsize house but still live in this area when not living in {COUNTRY Europe}. Hopefully, children and grand children will visit regularly.
