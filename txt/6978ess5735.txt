			 I am still working full-time as a nurse and I am still very active I go swimming regularly and take long walks in the countryside or along the canal. My finances are far better and I can enjoy at least 2 holidays a year I have had all the alterations I wanted doing on my house and I am very pleased with the outcome, my granddaughter is now 15 and has brought her first boyfriend round to meet me, we are very close and often go shopping together. My house is still an open house with my family popping in to visit on a daily basis. My husband has now learnt to drive and is doing well in the business I helped him start up a far cry from the factory work he used to do. On the whole we have a very happy and fulfilling life together and although we are not rich in financial term we are very comfortable and blessed with 8 children between us and lot of grandchildren.
