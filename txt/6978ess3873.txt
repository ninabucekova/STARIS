			 I am enjoying keeping fit by walking & swimming and enjoy going to the theatre/cinema, reading, watching rugby league, visiting NT properties, cooking and decorating the home and gardening. I still enjoy my job as supply teacher and have happy home life with my husband and enjoy visiting relatives and friends and holidays by the sea and abroad.
