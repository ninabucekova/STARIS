			 I have been living in {PLACE}, {COUNTRY Europe}, for ten years now and I enjoy the work I do: teaching English and doing my art and music. I feel great because of the quality of the food I eat. Due to the fact that my wife and I speak fluent Catalan we are totally integrated into the community and life is good. I am still in touch with my family and friends back in Britain and sometimes they come to visit for holidays. Due to the climate, we can plan walks and outdoor parties. It's nice to be out of the cold and damp.
