			 I would hope to be either working part time or to have moved to a less stressful job. I woul like to be spending time with my wife seeing our two children who I hope would have produced grandchildren by then! I would like to have moved to a smaller property which would afford us more time to travel and perhaps take up hobbies I have let go in recent years. I would like to have regained my fitness as a result of more free time.
