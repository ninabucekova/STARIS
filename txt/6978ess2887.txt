			 Now that my children are both out of school & almost finished university, {HUSBAND} & I have far more time to go off & do things together. I am enormously enjoying being able to spend more time with him either in London going to UNCLEAR & concerts, UNCLEAR off to UNCLEAR & at last having a few holidays. Now I don't have such a menagerie of animals it frees me up a lot. My garden design business fits in well with this as I can fit it in around my life, rather as my hands on gardening did when the children were small. {HUSBAND} is conducting music so we are busy arranging concerts for him. I suppose his daughters may well be married & have children by now, so I expect we may be required for some babysitting duties. My own garden is finally more mature & we are about to extend the house which will make a huge difference.
