			 I am enjoying retirement and although I have always loved teaching, understand why it's not suited to the 60+. Secondary education takes a lot of energy so I shall relish a little home tutoring to keep some pin money coming in. It is lovely to spend more time doing the things I enjoy and I am very pleased to be going to adult education classes and learning Italian and History of Art. I just love being a grandmother and helping my children with their little ones. It's also lovely to have more time in my home and with my husband and friends. I still do charity work and enjoy that and meeting new people at the centre. Life is good!
