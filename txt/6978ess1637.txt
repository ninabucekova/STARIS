			 I still go to work as a HCA for the NHS 2 evening aweek (7.30 11.00pm), on the community. I don't think I would carry on if I didn't enjoy it. My children have all left home and are living in various corners of the world. Gardening is still my passion and it keeps me fit, although my husband and I still attend our local fitness centre regularly were we spend time in the gym and the swimming pool. I think I probably get tired much quicker than I used to but if I pace myself well this isn't usually a problem.
