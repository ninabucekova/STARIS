			 At 60 I still look good for my age (as I do at 50!) I've sailed through the menopause. My children are settled and don't rely on me for money. I am settled in my home. I don't work everyday I only work a few hours a week and spend time enjoying new hobbies and ventures. I'm still healthy, don't have any illnesses or aches and pains, and have enough money to be able to pursue these.
