			 I imagine that I will be psychologically robust enough to cope with life and to continue to make a useful contribution. I will continue to enjoy my family and friends. However, I am very concerned about the state of the environment and I have very little idea of the kind of life that will be available in another ten years. I worry what the future holds for my own children and for young people around the world. I don't expect to be able to retire because I don't have a pension, and I hope that I will still be healthy enough to work. Although I feel reasonably confident about my own abilitites and achivements I think that I will be deeply affected by the difficulties that lie ahead for human kind.
