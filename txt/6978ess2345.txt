			 I would like to be working full time in a well paid job that is interesting. I want to buy a house nearer to the Sea, I would like to have grand-children and would want to be involved in their care. Hopefully I will still be fit and healthy and go walking regularly. I would like to be in a relationship with a man - not necessarily living together though!
