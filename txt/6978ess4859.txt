			 Hopefully I will be retiring about now. I won't have any debts or mortgage. My wife will have been retired for 4-5 years. We will spend 6 months of the year abroad in our own property. My income from investments, savings and pensions will allow us to be comfortable and able to not worry about finances. Health wise I should be able and hope to be around for at least another 20 years. I'll enjoy gardening and socialising with friends.
