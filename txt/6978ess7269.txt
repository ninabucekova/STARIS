			 This last 12 months has been a turning point for me. My own children 14 & 19 years old live in Australia. I havent seen them in 3 years. I havent put closure on my children. They left 10 years ago & I still phone & write. The last 3 years I cant afford to go & see them. At 60 I anticipate I will be living with or married to my girlfriend. Living with is imminent. She was my training Officer & mentor I was her student albeit mature. I am the junior member of our team but also the assistant manager. Quite bizzare but the team are happy with it. I dont want to be the manager but remain as I am living with {PARTNER} & her 2 boys as a supportive figure & help them with thier learning difficulties. Also being the first Prosthetist in {COUNTRY Asia} & flying out from time to time to fit limbs there. I want to see my own children again & wish to bring them to the UK for a holiday.
