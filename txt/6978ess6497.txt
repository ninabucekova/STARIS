			 How wonderful to at last be free of the tyranny of work. I have taken careful stock of my finances (thank heaven my investments recovered from that awful time 10 yrs ago) & feel I can afford to make arrangement with my Practice to do just a few locum sessions when they need me (& I want to). I have a kind & helpful partner (so glad I divorced 10 Y ago but it took along time to recover), the 2 children have lovely babies & I want to be a helpful interested grandma, the free bus pass & train pass will help. I will do lots of travelling perhaps spend the winter months abroad... I am in excellent health still, still doing Yoga & singing in the Choral Society, now have more time for days out, playing the piano, reading all these books.... time for friends and family at last!
