			 I have recently retired on my 60th birthday, having worked hard all my life. I am enjoying having more time to spend:- gardening, swimming walking, travelling. I am looking forward to joining new clubs which I have never had time for before eg dancing, flower arranging, bowling. I love having more time to spend with my 2 daughters and their children.
