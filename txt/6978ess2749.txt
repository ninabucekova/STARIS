			 I have endeavoured to keep fit & healthy although my joints (particularly lower back & hips) are slowing me down slightly, however, as I suffered and since recovered from breast cancer in 2006, I feel lucky to be alive. I still play badminton, even if I'm not as spritely as I was 10 year ago, it is more of a social thing. I still jog when I feel up to it & walk the dog. I also belong to an art group. I have a few grandchildren now, all under 10 years old and we visit & are visited by them & their parents (our children) to whom we are very close. this will be our 41st wedding anniversary, which we feel is a great achievement considering the divorce rate. We will soon be selling this largeish house we brought our children up in, to release some capital to retire with, as the pensions my husband paid into privately have not come to much and the state pension is inadequate. I might carry on working part time as I enjoy going out to work and it gives me a feeling of self worth.
