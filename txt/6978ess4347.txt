			 I expect, when I am 60, I will be living in a smaller house, but probably still in Edinburgh. My husband will be retiring, and my two children may be married with children of their own. I think family life is important and hope they think so too! I shall be more involved in voluntary work, and I think I will still be pretty fit and active - plenty of golf and walking. I hope we can do a bit more travelling while we are still able, if we can afford it.
