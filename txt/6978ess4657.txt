			 At 60, I've remained in my employment as in-house solicitor, legal and compliance officer of PERSONAL where I have been for 13 years and I'm a Regional Director of the Company. My wife {WIFE} and I have celebrated 24 years of marriage together and we have moved home to be nearer our seconday schooling requirements for our son {SON} who is now 14 years of age and attending PERSONAL as a dayboy. I'm looking forward to taking up some other occupational role at 65, perhaps writing which I enjoy, try a UNCLEAR novel, running a small tearoom or something so that I don't stagnate. I've now given up squash which I played on a weekly basis & tennis and play a round of golf once a week. I fancy trying a language or history open university qualification and once {SON} is at college to carrying this through. Generally my health is reasonable and I've managed to reduce my weight from what it was at 50 to 14 stones now. I attend many sporting events and take him to see {TEAM1} and {TEAM2} when we are able. My wife and I regularly attach comments. My elderly parents passed away and apart from my UNCLEAR and family and my cousins we have no immediate relations.
