			 I imagine my life at 60 to be much the same as now with more Grand children & very full. I also imagine that we can find the time to holiday moe with the family as well. I think we will walk more & maybe have more time for each other. I am sure we will live well I can't imagine this house to be empty it won't seem right but in life you adjust. We have UNCLEAR a strength in our family commitment to my parents as well as our Grand Children.
