			 My home and garden are now finally completed as I want them. I have more time to spend in my garden and going to visit family. I still have very close ties with all my family. I am still working but only my full time job, I have been able to give up working in the evenings as I am now slightly more financially secure. I still enjoy learning new skills either self-taught or evening classes and still travel abroad for holidays. Reading is still my first love and spending time with my relations. My health is not as good as it was, but I do take more care of myself and try to exercise and eat more healthily.
