			 I continue to work in my current job or I may have been promoted. I will be working full time. I will be fairly fit and healthy. I will be living in the same house, with my husband (same one!) I may have young grandchildren. I will have more disposable income as school fees / university & generally helping the children financially wil be less: I may try to save for my grandchildren / pass money to them, but I will also use any increased income to travel more widely & in better style than I now do. I may have responsibility in relation to my parents who would then be 88, but they are likely to be financially self sufficient. I would still feel, I hope, quite "young" & be very active.
