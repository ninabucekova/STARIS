			 Now that I am sixty I am pleased to say that I still enjoy good health which helps me enjoy life to the full! My family is very important to me - my husband & I have a strong & loving marriage (we have nearly been married for 40 year!) Our three children are now all happily married & settled with good jobs. We now have several grandchildren. I am now working a few hours a week to keep some money coming in but I'll possibly be looking to retire in the near future. I am sure I will continue with some sort of voluntary work for as long as I can. My Christian Faith is very important to me & this influences much of my life, both with church & other voluntary activities. My faith also helps me to cope with problems in life as I feel supported by prayer & practical support from my friends & family. I still play my bass guitar although I wonder how many more years I can continue with this (a grey haired lady playing bass!). I still enjoy my weekly exercise class which also helps to keep my weight down! We still enjoy our caravan holidays taken in this beautiful country.
