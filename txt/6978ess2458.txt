			 Imagine that I am 60? Hmm. Who knows what I will be doing in 9 or 10 years time. I suppose it's not unreasonable to imagine that I will be doing the same thing that I am doing now. My health is OK. I rarely go to the Doctors. Home life is OK, I am co-habiting with a girl called [NAME] who is 13 years my junior. We get on very well together. I am on the Committee of my Local Working Men's Club, which takes up a fair bit of my spare time. With that and often doing little jobs or favours for other people, I often find it difficult to find the time for things that I want to do. Such as: Rebuilding my motorbike or practicing the guitar which I am going to evening classes for. I may well have a rest from the Club committee this year as there are thing that I really want to get going on. Sorting out peoples computer problems is another thing I'm often asked to do. Why can't everyone just buy a Macintosh, then there would be no problems. Never mind, first beer festival of the year in a couple of weeks, happy days.
