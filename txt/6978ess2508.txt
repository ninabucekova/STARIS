			 I retired from my job as a Learning support tutor this year. My husband has already retired. I am a member of a local health club and enjoy swimming and walking. I love gardening and reading and am a member of a reading group. I have had both my hips replaced and now enjoy excellent mobility just the odd ache and pain. I do half a day voluntary work for the homeless, preparing meals in their hostel. I have two grandchildren who I see often. We go on weekend country breaks and enjoy walking in Britain. Hopefully one day I will be able to retire to my beloved Isle of Man.
