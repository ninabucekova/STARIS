			 Ive never really thought that far ahead in time but there are still a few things Id like to do in life. Like to go swimming with real wild dolphins one day and also to visit my UNCLEAR country Finland for a holiday. Or even go and live there as I feel Id really fit in living in Finland as for my health I had a check up at my Doctors a few weeks ago and was given a full bill of health so I am fine right now in time and hope to stay that way in the future. My interest at this time is music and I like watching football games on the tele. As for work right now Im looking for a job at this moment but the future does not look good there right now or for anyone else right now. But that is not a real problem that I would worry about at all as there is more to life than work and money like happiness which as always been more important to me anyway. So as long as Im happy thats all I need and right now worrying about things that you can do nothing about is there thats my motto anyway and as always been and its kept me going this far.
