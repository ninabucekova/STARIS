			 When I reach 60 I would like to think that I would still be working albeit partime in a job I enjoy. Also I hope I am with a partner who I love unconditionally. My child will have been thro university & be happily settled in a good job of her choice. Also I have enough money to do things I enjoy, like holidays, cars etc. My health would be good as I consider myself a fit & healthy woman.
