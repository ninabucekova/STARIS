			 I have worked for many years as a part-time teacher of adults who wish to learn English (either as a second language or who wish to improve their literacy skills). This has allowed me to spend time with my daughters as they grow up, whilst at the same time providing an interesting job and good income. When I finally got into a regular working pattern in a job that paid reasonably well, I was able to spend some leisure time doing things I wanted to do, instead of being pre-occupied with my family or work, so now I am able to go swimming or play tennis, to go to museums, galleries, the theatre or cinema and to take up pastimes such as studying French, learning about art, learning the guitar - things I have never had the time for before. I know my girls are in good jobs and good relationships - they are happy and so am I.
