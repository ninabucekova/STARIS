			 Now that I am 60 I have retired from my full time job as an Assistant Head Teacher although I sometimes return to class, to do some supply teaching, as I was concerned that I would miss work, especially the children & my colleagues. I think I will get used to retirement though, as already I am spending more time painting (although an art specialist I didn't have sufficient time to paint when teaching). I am noticing that I am less stressed now; I enjoyed teaching immensely but the stress levels were high. I have greater time to enjoy my home now, have taken on some home improvements & enjoying new recipes, etc. I am grateful that my health is still good so that I can enjoy life to the full, especially my role as a grandparent!
