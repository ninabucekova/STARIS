			 I WOULD IMAGINE THAT AT 60 I WOULD NOT BE WORKING FULL TIME AND MAY BE DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO KEEP MY MIND WORKING. I HOPE TO BE FINANCIALLY SECURE AND LIVING ABROAD OR SOMEWHERE WHERE I FEEL A SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND CALM. I EXPECT TO BE IN GOOD HEALTH AND WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AFTER MYSELF PHYSICALLY, MENTALLY AND SPIRITUALLY. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO TRAVEL A LOT MORE AND TO EXPERIENCE NEW THINGS. I LIKE TO LEARN NEW SKILLS AND IMPROVE MYSELF IN ALL AREAS, AND I AM VERY KEEN ON SELF DEVELOPMENT. I WILL HOPE TO CONTINUE TO KEEP USING THE GYM AND BE PHYSICALLY ACTIVE IN WHATEVER I DO. I IMAGINE I WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE A GOOD CIRCLE OF FRIENDS WHO I HAVE HAD FOR MANY YEARS AND CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN THOSE BONDS AS THE YEARS GO ON.
