			 I hope to be retired, living with my husband on the South {PLACE South West England} Coast. I hope both my children are settled in jobs they enjoy and living with partners. I will perhaps have grandchildren with which to spend time, I will swim, play tennis and go to the Gym regularly. I will attend the local church and be doing some sort of voluntary work. I will enjoy spending time gardening and cooking. I hope to still be in good health.
