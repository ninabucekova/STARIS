			 I see myself as a fairly healthy and fit person, who hopefully will still be working as a part time Phlebotomist who enjoys the social interaction and may still need the pennies. My husband will be retired and my children will hopefully be happy and financially independant. I hope to pursue my interest in dance and may be learning how to play the guitar. My husband and I will be more relaxed with less family responsibilities and able to enjoy more leisure time together.
