			 I have just turned 60 and am still at work but now that the mortgage is paid and the children are independent the money goes towards supporting my interests and providing for the future. I enjoy listening to music and going to concerts and theatre. I love to travel and have two holidays abroad and several short breaks during the year. My husband and I enjoy socialising with friends and family at least once a week - usually at our home or theirs but occasionally eating out. My health is reasonably good although I have more aches and pains than I used to and my eyesight is deteriorating. I still enjoy playing on the Wii especially Wii fit and rock band - I worry less about things in general and am more relaxed than when I was younger. Life is good.
