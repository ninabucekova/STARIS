			 I am now 60, I have given up working (paid) but I do a voluntary job, which I enjoy. My husband and I are considering if we haven't already retiring to {PLACE South West England} and I would like to pursue my craft hobbies. I still enjoy swimming and try to go twice a week if I can as I still have arthritis and swimming helps me strengthen my muscles. I would like to try and keep up aqua aerobics too. Our son is now hopefully at university or pursuing a career in art or graphics, but if not, I would be happy with whatever he does, as long as he's happy. I hope I won't be a gran just yet, but I'm looking forward to the day when or if we become grandparents.
