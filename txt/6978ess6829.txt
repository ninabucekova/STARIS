			 I am continuing my life as usual. Concentrating on efforts to ensure my UNCLEAR is in place. I am making efforts to control my health for my retirement. Hopefully my interests have not changed and I am living a fullfilled life. I am working as usual & not so many hours as I have been, depending on my health and financial situation. Glad that the recession is over.
