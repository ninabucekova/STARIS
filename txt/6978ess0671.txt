			 I hope to still have my own business, but that it does not take up most of my time. I would like a property abroad and then to look at developing my life more and more abroad with my family and less in this country. I hope to be well health wise and to have enough money to do the things I want to do. I would like to look to retire or semi retire at 60 but still have income from my business adventures.
