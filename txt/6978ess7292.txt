				 National Child Development Study: Sweep 8, 2008-2009 
		 
			 By the age of 60 I will have been retired from the RAF for 5 years. However, I would expect to have kept working, albeit on a part time basis to keep mind and body active. The children will have left home by then so we will have more time to devote to our shared/individual hobbies/activities. For me this will include keeping fit (running), language studies, gardening, literature and exploring the country around us. We do not expect to move from our current house but will continue to develop our links in the community.
