			 I IMAGINE THAT I WILL HAVE MOVED TO A SMALLER HOUSE OR EVEN POSSIBLY RETIRED ABROAD. I WILL STILL BE CLOSE TO MY FAMILY & CHILDREN & GRANDCHILDREN. I HOPE TO BE LEADING A MUCH QUIETER LIFE, WITH MY HUSBAND AND I MAYBE TRAVELLING AROUND THE UK. VISITING PLACES WE NEVER HAD TIME FOR BEFORE. HEALTH WISE PROBABLY ARTHRITIS AND BACK PAIN. I WOULD MAYBE DO SOME VOLUNTARY WORK AT CHARITY SHOPS SO I HAD A REASON TO GET UP EVERYDAY AND MEET PEOPLE, AND HOPEFULLY FULFILLING MY LOVE OF READING.
