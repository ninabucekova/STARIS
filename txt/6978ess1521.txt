			 It is now 5 years since I retired from the British Army having served a full career since joining at 18 years of age. Since that time I have worked in the human resources field in land managment. I live in the same house with my wife {WIFE}, who is a head of a local primary school. We are active in our church, and take regular walks and go on short holidays throughout Europe. Our 4 daughters are all happily married some with Grandchildren who come to visit and stay on a regular basis. We continue to try to make the best of our lives, living as Christians
