			 Aged 60 I will be five short years from retirement and looking forward to the opportunity of doing more of the enjoyable things in life. Taking things easier and perhaps travelling. The oppotunities I look forward to most are reading more, sewing and cooking. I also look forward to having time to visit friends and have them to stay in more relaxed fashion than is possible now. I look forward to watching the progress through life of my three children and sharing in all their triumphs and tribulations and lending a listening ear as and when appropriate. As I have always exercised and eaten a healthy diet, I am optimistic my future plans will not be stymied by ill health.
