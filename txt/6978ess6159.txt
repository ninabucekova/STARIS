			 Probably still working to support my family and retirement. Hopefully my children have all received a good education and are on their way in life to a successful future. I hope my health is good so I can enjoy walking, gardening, taking holidays and short breaks with my husband. I'd like to pursue hobbies and interests and have more time for myself after bringing up four children. I anticipate moving to smaller house and maybe area of the country, perhaps nearer to my family. More time to read and play piano, enough money to visit the theatre from time to time. Quality time spent with family and friends.
