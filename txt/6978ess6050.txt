			 Working part-time in my husbands business, helping with the running of the office and serving customers. My health is still fine do not smoke or drink. Moved to a smaller house so housework an running the house is a lot easier and garden is a lot less upkeep than it was at my old house. Because I only work part-time I have a lot more time to spend on my interests such as walking the dog, decorating meeting with friends for lunch or drinks. My husband and I are also still going out regularly as we have always done, together or with friends.
