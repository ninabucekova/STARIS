			 Well I am a very happy married, I wished we had a bit more money as I feel we are working just to pay bills. We both stopped smokeing in April and we can't even save this money. we dont drink, drive, or go out but I am quite happy with life. We would love to renew our marriage vowls in five years time when we have our silver wedding anniversary. My interests are cross stitching, and making cards.
