				 National Child Development Study: Sweep 8, 2008-2009 
		 
			 My children are in their mid-twenties and have finished university courses in History of Art and media/journalism. I am still working and must continue to do so for as long as possible. Much of the last few years had been spent in ensuring my children have been able to study. My financial future is looking very difficult as I will not have sufficient pension for prolonged retirement in comfort. Previous comforts taken for granted may be out of reach through lack of savings /pension. I have no alternative other than to continue to work.
