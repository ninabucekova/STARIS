			 I would like to think that because my husband's business (which started 10 years ago) is now very successful, I am enjoying the life that the proceeds from this brings. Spending more time with grandchildren, travelling & enjoying life in general, maybe doing abit of voluntary work. Usual wear & tear on health, hopefully reasonable weight to cope with the ageing process.
