			 I am still with the same wife and still working, albeit the work has changed in order to reduce the amount of travelling. My health is satisfactory and I am still able to participate in physical activities, such as: sport, walking, diy and gardening, as is my wife. We have similar interests to those we have enjoyed for many years. The mortgage is paid, which reduces financial pressure and the need to try to sustain the same level of income. I expect to work unitl 65 as we have only modest pension provision despite contributing throughout our working lives. I am frustrated by the absence of communities and the increased isolation of people and families within their homes, their refuge, where they seem to look inwards and ignore the wider 'family' that is the social network we inhabit. This isolation is worrying as we grow older.
