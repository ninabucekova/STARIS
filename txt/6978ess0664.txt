			 What an interesting question - + thank you for a thought provoking questionnaire. At 60 I guess I'll still be helping people to know Jesus! It's the most important thing in my life and when you've found something good you want to share it. Wherever God takes me to do that is up to Him. (If I don't make it to 60 for some reason, then I have a firm belief where I'm going next is even better than this life!) I would hope my sons might have married and I would enjoy being a granny eventually. I have kept all my children's toys just in case!!
