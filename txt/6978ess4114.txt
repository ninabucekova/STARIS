			 I am now 60, possibly I may have moved house but whether it is to a larger or smaller one is dependent on the family. I would hope to have grandchildren and in an ideal world, have them to visit not be living with them! I would like to be as healthy, as would my wife, even though I probably will still be working full time. I think I wil take more holidays than I take at present, but they will be more leisurely then in the past. I will probably walk more with my wife.
