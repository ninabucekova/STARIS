			 At 60 I shall be living with my husband. My children will be largely independent and may be in relationships of their own. I would still be working on a part time basis but I hope that I would have more time to pursue my interests. I hope that I would be fit enough to pursue my current physical activities - running & cycling and there would be more time to go skiing or perhaps watersports. I also hope there would be more time to pursue my creative interests. I would hope that my health continues to be good. I may be involved in supporting my elderly parents who may not be living independently by then. I would hope that we could travel a little if funds allow - perhaps to South America - maybe I could have an adult Gap year!
