			 I am happy with my lot. I continue to be involved in performing music, photography and walking. My home life is good - we have a nice house, kids at university and time to share with each other. My health continues to be good and exercise and try to look after myself. The businesses are still running and we have cut back on our hours, now employing a manager for the day to day running.
