			 I believe I will still be working full time to keep making ends meet financially. My children will be 31 & 26 by then and I hope to be a grandmother at least once. I don't know if both my children would have left home, but at that age I hope not to be expected to be at their beck and call - except for my husband who has always expected it! My legs are my weakest part of my body but I hope they will be no worse than when I was 50. I have always enjoyed sewing and I hope that I still can do odd jobs and that my machine (sewing machine) is still going strong. (It would be 43 years old by then)
