			 I am currently running my own businesses, 2 caravan parks and a holiday caravan dealership. My children are early 20's and finishing university education. By 60 I hope to remain fit and active. Possibly beginning to work part time having employed others to take over day to day activities. Family is very important and I hope perhaps to have grandchildren and to have the time to spend with them. I also expect if either my mother or mother in law are alive (both 82) to spend time caring for them. my business are my pension fund so it will be necessary to ensure they run properly - and should help keep me active. We can be hope!
