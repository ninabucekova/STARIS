			 I have recently moved into a house which I had built to my own specifications and requirements. I'm still working (self-employed) as it's been such an important part of my life, that I can't imagine not doing it, although I have other income from other projects or property. I have also been the main wage earner (sometimes the only) during my married life and feel a huge responsibility to maintain financial security (unlike my parents - both self-employed). I continue to take regular exercise, maintain my weight and enjoy a healthy and varied diet. I was diagnosed with depression some years ago, but medication works well with other lifestyle therapies. I may now still have to take medication. I can now travel more, take more holidays and be a regular theatre - goer - which I never found time for before. I hope in 10 years from now that "60 is the new 40"! P.S. And I want to still be wearing lipstick and nail varnish!!
