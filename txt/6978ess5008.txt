			 So here I am at 60 still driving my beloved sports car. My back is a little stiffer and getting in and out sometimes a problem but I think I am in better condition than the car. My husband is now 78 and I have been at home looking after him since I retired 5 years ago. Most of the interests I have revolve around the home and looking after all my exotic pets,. I have just started an Art Foundation Course, Something I wanted to do 42 years ago but my parents told me I had to get a proper job. Funny how I eventually ended up teaching art! The children still live at home and are still saving up for their own places. Their company keeps us young and all their friends poping in is a pleasure. I'm still trying to get used to wearing glasses and use my dyslexia as an excuse when the writing is too small to see. I probably need a hearing aid, thats next on my list of things to do.
