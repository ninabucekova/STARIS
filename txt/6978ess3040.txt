			 I have more time for hobbies and interests, perhaps travelling more frequently - I live happily with my wife - my sons have their own lives, perhaps married or with long term partners. My wife and I spend time together and with close friends. I still work, but maybe not full-time. I am still reasonably fit, able to (for example) enjoy walks in the country or cycling - with good health. We've moved to smaller house, the spare equity from the sale providing additional financial security. We eat out fairly often, we enjoy theatre & cinema. Our life together is more relaxed - we dictate the pace - we are still happy and in love.
