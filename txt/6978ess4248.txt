			 As current and recent times have been rather difficult - health-wise and work-wise, I would hope that I am working, healthy and happy, enjoying family life with my children and grandchildren and it would be nice to be in a loving relationship, as I am currently on my own. Sharing good times and holidays with friends. I would hope that my family and friends are also happy & healthy.
