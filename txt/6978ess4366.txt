			 At 60 I would be more independent as my daughter will of left home, so I would hope to travel more, in the UK & abroad. I hope that I would have a partner, maybe live with them, but somebody special to enjoy life with. I would hope to be running my own business still, but not necessarily put too much time into it, hopefully it can run itself more. Maybe working part time. I expect my interests to be the same as they are now, pub bands, giggs, travel, socialising, dog showing, keeping fit, films, books tv! Health, well who knows, I live a healthy life so I hope to be well, fit & active!
