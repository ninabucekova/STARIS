			 I am retired after a full & happy career as a music teacher. I'm living with my long term partner {PARTNER}, & we have a wee dog. I work for the RSPCA trying to stop puppy farms. I have been diabetic for 48 years, but I'm generally in good health. My Mum is an amazing 91, she is in a home near me in Edinburgh. I have lots of fun with my friends - mostly retired teachers who I've known for years. I love walking & going to Italy.
