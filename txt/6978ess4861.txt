			 I'm living in a small 2-bed house in a village working in the job I have done for the past 24 years and looking forward to retirement. Socially spending time with family/grandchildren and quality time with my husband. Still remaining active by walking and other exercise. Can comfortably afford to live financially and have a couple of holidays abroad each year.
