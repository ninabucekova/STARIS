			 At the age of 60 i still expect to be working full time just to keep a roof over my familys head. If im still in the same employment i expect my health to suffer. Due to money restraints i expect my life to be as it is now ie. get up go to work come home go to bed get up for work. My home life as it is now should be good. As i have no real intrest now i do not expect that to change due to money constraints.
