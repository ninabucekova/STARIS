			 I expect to be retired, not rich but able to cope on my small pension untill state pension is payable at 65. Would like to be spending at least 6 months per year abroad in the warmer climate of Cyprus. May need to work part time or volunteer to fill my days. Hope my partner will still be around to share it all with me. Relatively healthy hopefully.
