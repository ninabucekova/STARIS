			 I have retired after many years in a job I did enjoy, but am now able to do as I please, I enjoy the garden which I am able to do as my health is good. I enjoy meeting my 'girlfriends' for lunch mid-week. My husband and I as we are both retired enjoy eating out and going away on mid-week breaks.
