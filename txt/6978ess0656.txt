			 I imagine that at 60 I will still be working I enjoy my job and cannot imagine my life without working although I may reduce the hours I work. Will probably have moved to a smaller house possibly a bungalow with spare bedroom for future grandchildren. With the children grown up & left home will have more time for my own interests, I enjoy walking, gardening going the theatre & craft work. I cannot imaging myself other than healthy & active and if anything changes then I'll deal with it as it comes.
