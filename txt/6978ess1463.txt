			 As I reach the ripe old age of 60 years in this world, I reflect back on my life so far. I feel resentful that I have continue working for another 5 years, before retirement from work. I have been Nursing for 42 years. I feel I need a break now and want to do other things with what is left of my life. However I have to continue working so I can afford to live. Money is tight and everything very expensive. My health is Good and I feel well. My family are close and I enjoy spending time with all of them. I have my Scottie dogs to care for and enjoy walking long distance breaks, on beaches, woods and quiet areas. I haven't much time left for anything else. I wonder what the future will bring.
