			 When I am sixty I would expect my life to be much the same as it is today. Fortunately the company I work for seems to value experience with about 10% of the staff being around sixty. My kids are still fairly young as I would expect that they will still be living in the family home. I'm fairly active playing golf and walking regularly, so hopefully I'll be healthy.
