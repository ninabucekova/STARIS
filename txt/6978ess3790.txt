			 I am happily married to my wife {WIFE} and continue to spend 6 months living at our home in France and 6 months in the U.K. Having retired full time at reaching 60, we now have to decide whether to live in France full time or to sell our French house and move elsewhere. Boating continues to be an important aspect of our lives. Having lost weight, I feel better and fitter with less pain coming from my knees!
