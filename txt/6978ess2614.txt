			 When I am 60 years of age. I hope to be working and earning a living but in a flexible way so I can go on holidays and sing in choirs. I will be more musically qualified and not as fit. though I would like to increase my stamina as part of the recovery from my illness. I hope that I can have a relationship with someone I life and that I would not have to worry about a pension. If I had my life to live again I would not have cared for others but put myself first - it is only as you get older that you realise that giving is one-sided.
