			 At 60 I hope to be healthy enough to be able to carry on enjoying my life. I would like to be working part-time still but may retire if my husband has done so. Then we can both spend time together travelling and visiting parts of the world I have not seen yet. I expect to be living in the same area but the children (now 17 + 19) will be living independently & so we may downsize. I would like to take up more leisure activities but would like that to involve more education - such as further IT courses.
