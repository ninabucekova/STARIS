			 I will probably be fairly healthy outlook is bleak, may not have my house which may be repossesed my parents may not be around, my wife may not be around as she is a diabetic and is on insulin. Children will all be grown up and married apart from my son who will be 17yrs old and hopefully in full time education. I will be in a lot of debt. God bless us all!
