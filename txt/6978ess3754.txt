			 I would have liked to have retired at 60 as I always expected to in my working life but will no longer be able to (due to government changes). When I do retire I would like to move to a home easier to maintain. I always have animals around me as long as I am fit enough to look after them properly, they are my main source of happiness and reason for living (and reason for exercise). I will continue to see friends and my daughter. I will continue to enjoy my garden, reading etc. I will no doubt be exhausted at work (if still in the same type of employment as it is quite physical). I will continue to be on a low wage and then even less on a pension. So a mixture of good and bad things I envisualise for my future.
