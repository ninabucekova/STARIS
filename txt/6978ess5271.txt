			 I would be fit, walking, swimming & doing yoga. I would be travelling and making dinners for friends as well as doing something creative such as painting or drawing. I would like to be with my husband who will be retired, working part-time in a voluntary capacity a couple of days a month. Gardening and visiting relatives would also be important. We both love swimming and snorkelling and walking so these would be great things to be doing if we keep fit. Seeing family would also be nice as I love cooking and looking after people.
