			 I am working as a teacher, and doing social work with an agency few hours per week as I need the money. I doubt have a pension as I have not been able to earn enough money per week/month to live let alone putting funds into pension plan so I will unfortunately have to work until my time ends - I am not able to work more than a few hours per week 16hrs? maybe due to disability which has been progressive since the age of 40ish I do enjoy my work and it is very important to me, my incapacity benefit stopped at 60 so financially living is very difficult. I have many hobbies which are very important, painting, creative needlework but do not get much time as am tired after work and in increased pain. Grandchildren very important to me.
