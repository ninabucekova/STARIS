			 I work 2 or 3 days a week and spend time with my grandchildren going to our holiday home in Wales. I continue to ski - badly and play tennis regularly. Golf is still a difficult game for me but I percevere. We are a close knit family and my wife has retired. We are lucky and in good health even though I am on medication for hypertension and cholesterol. We spend time with our friends on their boat and have a good and varied social life. I have found time to write.
