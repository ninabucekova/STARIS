			 I am living with my partner and we are both working full time. Our children have left home and we have more time to do the things we want to do, such as sport and leisure activities including more holidays abroad and visits to the theatre and weekends away. We see our children and grandchildren regularly and also friends and keep in touch with other members of our families. We are in good health and are happy.
