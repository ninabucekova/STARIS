			 I would hope to be living in a small house/cottage (with my wife) in a village in the North of England. We would hopefully not have a mortgage. The house would have some land and we would grow most of our own vegetables. We would go walking a good deal. I would still expect to be working but preferably not 40 hours a week for virtually the whole year. We would still travel around Europe - a couple of trips per year. Relatives and friends would come to visit/stay and we would visit them in turn.
