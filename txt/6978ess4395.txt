			 Now I am 60, my life is still full of things to do. I enjoy taking my girlfriend on holiday, going snorkelling & scuba diving. I have a good job with a good salary, I have to travel to get to my work but I don't find it a problem. I am regularly in contact with my three children & my 3 grand children, I spoil them when I can. My ex-wife I haven't heard from since the Divorce. I hear from my kids that she is happy. I am happy for her. I am in regular contact with my brother & sister, my father is now 96 & is still driving. My brother & I go diving together usually somewhere warm, my sister sends my post cards from her latest cruise, and pictures of her latest grandchild.
