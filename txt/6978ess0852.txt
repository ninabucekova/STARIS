			 I will be retired from my job as a teacher, but still expect to do some supply work in local schools, when I feel like it or perhaps tutor students A/GCSE level. My job has meant that I have spent my hours at home preparing and marking work, I will enjoy the free time to be even more active, walking, swimming etc and relaxing. I can see my wife and I taking extended vacations - winter months in the med, enjoying the climate, walking etc perhaps going to different parts of Greece etc every year. I feel that I should give something back to society and undertake voluntary work with disadvantaged children or similar groups. I expect my health to still be good and not hinder me in doing what I want to do.
