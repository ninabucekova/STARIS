			 I hope to be still living in my current house, working on it (it is old) and tending my garden. I hope to be still in good relations with my neighbours, both new and old. I hope to be fit and healthy and enjoying life. I hope I will still be cycling to work, as I have done for most of my working life. I hope to remain in my job (I have recently become a Senior manager in the NHS) and that I am still with the same Foundation Trust, but who knows, maybe a change would be good too! I hope I will have started and completed my psychoanaly UNCLEAR psychotherapy training, and have begun to practice. I hope I am still with my partner, (currently 16 years) I know I will always have my interest and passion for encouraging people to achieve their dreams, goals etc, no matter what.
