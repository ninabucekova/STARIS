			 I am retired and enjoying life with my husband. We are very active and visit friends and family often. We spend our time together walking, gardening cooking, travelling around the country visiting new places, particularly gardens. We eat out regularly and go abroad sometimes. We also entertain regularly. We are generally in good health and I am now much more relaxed since I gave up work.
