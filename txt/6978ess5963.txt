			 I still have my horses & ride despite my knee hurting. I can't give that up/ Two of the boys have left home & are doing well. The other two still need support. I am still tired, you can't fight all the problems I have without paying a price but my business has grown & we have inherited enough money to pay off the debts, but money is still a problem because you have to earn a huge amount to pay your own rent & have any money in your pocket. I have to look after my husband more now as his health has deteriorated, so we care for each other still.
