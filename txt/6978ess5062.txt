			 I still hope to be enjoying my current hobbies, computing, listening to music taking photographs and dabbling with small electronic circuits. At home we would be getting used to living without children/ young adults around us. I would like to think life would be more green with self sufficiency in terms of food and energy being great parts of our lives. I would be disappointed not to be able to cycle on at least 3-4 occasions a week. With the expected increase in free time, it would be good to explore more of the english countryside - more and longer walks in the fresh air. Some form of work, part time, would be required to help supplement an early withdrawl from full time employment. Part time consultancy or tuition work of some 2-3 days a week particularly in the winter months. I look forward to be able to enjoy more time with my wife and family as the working week shrinks. I would expect to have sufficient funds to be able to maintain the current lifestyle I enjoy. All in all it sounds a fun age to be!
