			 WELL I HAVE WON THE LOTTERY AND I'M LIVING IN THE CORNISH COUNTRYSIDE, I HAVE A LARGE GARDEN WHICH I GROW MY OWN FRUIT & VEG. MY HEALTH IS QUITE GOOD ALTHOUGH I'M DUE A HIP OPERATION. I STILL WORK PART-TIME. I'VE EXPANDED MY MEDAL COLLECTION AND HAVE QUITE A COLLECTION OF DE-ACTIVATED WEAPONS AND SWORDS. MY LEISURE TIME IS SPENT VISITING MUSEUMS AND ART GALLERIES. I ALSO ENJOY GOING METAL DETECTING WITH A COUPLE OF LIKE MINDED FRIENDS NOT FOR MONEY BUT FOR HISTORICAL VALUE.
