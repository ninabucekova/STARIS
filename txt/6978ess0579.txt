			 I am living in the same place, hopefully in a new house which we have built from scratch. I am still married to my husband {HUSBAND}. My 3 children have begun to establish their own separate lives with partners and perhaps with children of their own. UNCLEAR too, all hopefully not too far away. I am still working P-T as an educational psychologist and counsellor. I am still exercising 4 times a week and enjoying it. I am enjoying the company of my husband, children, friends & family. I am a happy person who enjoys life and is still energetic. I am still learning new things - perhaps taking a course or writing in some way too.
