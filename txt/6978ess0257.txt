			 I hope to have stopped work by the age of 60. We plan to downsize our house once both children have left home. If possible we would like to have a smaller home here and another abroad, possibly in {COUNTRY Europe}, but at the moment, financially this does not seem attainable. At present my health & fitness is good & I am quite optimistic it will stay good.
