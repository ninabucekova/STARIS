			 I am now retired and do volunatry work 1 afternoon per week. I look after my grandchildren two days a week. My husband and I go on holiday 3 times a year and enjoy going off for weekends. We still eat out often and socialise with our friends. We own a second home abroad, and spend as much time there as possible with the family.
