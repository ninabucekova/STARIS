			 I hope to be living in Switzerland between December & April. My kids visit me, hopefully with my grandchildren. I will still be skiing! I will spend 4-6 months a year in the UK & the remainder travelling. I will still be in business, monitoring everything from my laptop. I will have written at least one piece of music that I can leave as my imprint on the world. My kids will all be self sufficient in their home & work lives. My wife will find me attractive & vice versa.
