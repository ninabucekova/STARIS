			 I FEEL WELL ENOUGH TO DO THE THINGS I LIKE TO DO LIKE METAL DETECTING WALKING MY DOGS, AND KEEPING 2 HORSES. MY LIMBS/LEGS WONT ALLOW ME TO DO ANY HORSE RIDING BECAUSE MY KNEES HURT OFTEN. FINANCIALLY I AM OFTEN SHORT OF MONEY SO I DON'T GO ON HOLIDAYS ABROAD, A LOT OF OUR CASH IS SPENT KEEPING UP OUR HOUSEHOLD BILLS AND FEEDING ANIMALS. BASICALLY WE ARE VERY RARELY AT HOME APART FROM NIGHTIMES. MENTALLY I THINK I AM NORMALLY SOUND BUT QUITE OFTEN EMOTIONAL WHEN ALONE AND QUIET, BUT NORMALLY A HAPPY SMILING PERSON AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.
