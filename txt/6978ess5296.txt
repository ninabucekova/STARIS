			 I hope to still be at work, in my role of head of environment for magazine publishing - or some similar fulfilling role - To have more time to continue competitive water skiing, tennis and keeping fit for sport at a high level. And most importantly supporting my daughters in whatever career they have chosen. I'd like to think that I would have more leisure time and spare income to take extended vacations, with my husband & adult daughters - maintaining the close family relationship we have at 50 - as we all love waterskiing & could still do this together.
