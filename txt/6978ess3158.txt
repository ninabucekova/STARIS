			 Although my energy levels and fitness are not as good as they were I am determined not to be "old in my head". I enjoy learning new things and stretching my brain. I may be doing a college course to learn new things and to meet new people. I still enjoy meeting up with my friends regularly to have coffee and chat. I expect that I may have grandchildren and hope that I will be able to see my sons and their families often. By 60 I should have adapted to life without the boys being around all the time. I hope to be doing some part-time work to get me out and about and maybe doing some work from home too. I hope that I am still reasonably fit and mobile and enjoying my hobbies art, machine embroidery and belly dancing. Maybe I'll have some new hobbies by then!
