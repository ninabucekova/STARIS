			 I am now retired. Living quietly with my husband and my dog. I like to potter in the garden and go for long walks on the beach. I like to go for long lazy lunches, picnics in the summer. Spend afternoons chatting with my friends and drinking wine. I enjoy reading books (crime thrillers) and listening to music. I still go into the school from time to time to help the children at discovery play. I like to chat to the children and help them with their writing.
