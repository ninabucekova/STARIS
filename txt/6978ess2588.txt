			 At the age of 60, I would like to be active and participating in clubs, sports, and doing charitable work. I expect to be working in my nursing job because of the need financially but also because I feel I can contribute effectively still to caring for sick children as I am compassionate. My family (children) would have completed higher education or training courses and have satisfying work with valuable friends/relationships. I would hope to be healthy as I take care of my lifestyle. I would wish to have a stronger marriage relationship.
