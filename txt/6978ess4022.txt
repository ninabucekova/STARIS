			 At last I have left UK for good and now live in beautiful, peaceful, happy New Zealand. My life is simple but so very happy. I have a cute little house with a vegetable plot where I grow my own fresh vegetables. I have a simple campervan and take off a round New Zealand visiting many cafes and having delicious homemade muffins and great coffee as well as having a down to earth chat with a down to earth New Zealander. My health is fantastic due to less stress, I'm doing lots of walking & gardening. I try to avoid depressing news but feel calm with reading and knitting, I do the odd bit of beauty treatments from home to bring in some extra cash. I don't expect to be rich, but who cares, so long as I am happy & well.
