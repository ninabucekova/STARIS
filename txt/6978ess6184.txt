			 After having ill health for the last 10 years I take one day at a time. I can't imagine 10 years hence. I enjoy my Grandchildren and go on holiday when I'm well. I play darts once a week and do voluntary work with credit union and go to church once a week. I enjoy my life as it is and can't envisage any great changes. The biggest change will be that my husband will be retired by then, hopefully we'll be able to enjoy his retirement together.
