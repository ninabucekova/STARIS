			 I retired from my two part time jobs five years ago after my husband and I completed the renovation and extention of our low carbon house. We now spend our time looking after our three dogs and other assorted animals, we walk the dogs everyday which keeps us both active, a great deal of my time is spent looking after friends children, two nieces and three grand children. I enjoy cooking, gardening and visiting our friends. My mother of 85 lives with us but is still quite active and independent. I do voluntary work in the community two days a week and am involved with the village church. My health is reasonable although I have diabetes this does not limit my daily life. We travel within the UK frequently and further afield occasionally.
