			 I have very little idea what my life will be like in 10 years time. I have no idea waht work I will be doing and whether I will be living in the uk. It's possible that I might be married, it's possible I might be already dead. At 50, I am unemployed and have no recent work experience so that career directions are not strongly under my control. It's unclear to me whether I will have the drive to find something that makes sense for me or merely fall into a low-status and unrewarding role that brings low income and low sense of achievement. This outcome is liable to condition all others. I am still poor at taking on risk so may repeat past errors and settle for the safe and unrewarding.
