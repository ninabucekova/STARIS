			 I would like to think I am still enjoying a healthy life. exercising as I do now, although maybe a little more gentle!, I hope to have a school job. I am looking at present for something to fit in with the children, so by now I would be 'part of the furniture!!' so to speak. I would like to be better off financially and happy within a relationship - please wave your magic wand !!
