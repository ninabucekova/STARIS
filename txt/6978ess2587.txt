			 Hopefully at the age of 60, our mortgage will just be paid and retirement will either have happened a couple of years ago or about to happen. Money issues should not be a real problem as we should have a comfortable income from the company pension, and we do not have extravagant tastes. As a cardiac arrest struck me at the age of 50, realisation of the importance of living healthily has hit hard in terms of eating correctly and exercising. We regularly attend a gym and intend doing so at 60 and beyond. We would be looking to live near the coast as we both enjoy walking and cycling and would be doing more of these exercises at 60. Our holidays in our caravan would become regular and money permitting we would enjoy more of the world.
