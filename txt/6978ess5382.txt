			 I LIKE TO THINK I WILL HAVE FOUND A PARTNER WHO SHARES MY INTERESTS AND I HIS. TO BE HAPPY & HEALTHY ENOUGH TO ENJOY DOING DRESSAGE COMPETITIONS, DANCING, LONG WALKS WITH THE DOGS, EVEN A BIT OF GARDENING & D.I.Y. TO HAVE MORE TIME TO GO TO THEATRES & ART GALLERIES. WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO BE ABLE TO DO THESE THINGS WITHOUT HAVING TO WORK AGAIN. LOVELY.
