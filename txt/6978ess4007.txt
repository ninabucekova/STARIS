			 I decided by the time I reached 60 I would no longer be working full time and for the time being I only work a couple of mornings a week. The rest of the time I pursue interests such as writing, which I have always wanted to try. and photography which I have done for many years. This is something I am getting my niece interested in as a hobby. I am still with {HUSBAND} and we are now married. Since being married and not working such long hours and having more time to do activities I enjoy I find I am feeling healthier, happier and contented.
