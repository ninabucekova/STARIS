			 On my 60th year on this Earth, I would hope to be nearing retirement from my career as a nurse and looking forward to spending some time and money travelling to other Countries on holidays. I hope to be fairly healthy with a good physical and emotional well being. I will spend much more time with my family and friends: I have my own home in a lovely Market Town with lots of friends and family around me. I would perhaps live on my own, and have more time to invite people round for social evenings. I would plan to do some work, involving helping others as that has been my career. Hobbies, some art and some form of exercise to keep fit and young!
