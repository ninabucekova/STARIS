			 I'LL BE RETIRED FROM MY FULL-TIME JOB BUT DOING VOLUNTARY WORK PERHAPS 15 TO 20 HOURS A WEEK. I'LL BE FIT AND HEALTHY, GOING TO THE GYM TWICE A WEEK AND GOING FOR LONG WALKS. MOST LIKELY I WILL BE SPENDING UP TO 3 MONTHS A YEAR AT OUR HOME ABROAD. HOPEFULLY MY HUSBAND (WHO WILL BE 80 WHEN I AM 60) WILL BE STILL AROUND BUT HIS HEALTH MAY RESTRICT SOME OF OUR ACTIVITIES. I STILL EXPECT TO SEE THE FRIENDS I HAVE ACQUIRED OVER MY LIFETIME REGULARLY FOR FUN AND CATCHING UP - MAYBE I'LL BECOME A "LADY WHO LUNCHES"! I EXPECT TO HAVE LOTS OF TIME FOR THE THINGS I WANT TO DO NOW BUT STILL WANT TO HAVE PURPOSE AND ROUTINE IN MY LIFE.
