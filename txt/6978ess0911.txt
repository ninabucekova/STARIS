			 I am working less than I was at 50 but earning enough to be comfortable and happy. My marriage & my extending family continue to be a joy for me - my wife & I find lots of time for each other - to visit friends & just spend time together. My children (including my stepchildren) are leading fulfiling lives and they are happy. I see them reasonably often & enjoy being a grandparent (perhaps!) My health is good - a few niggles but nothing that prevents me from leading the life I want to lead. I am still living here & have built solid relationships with neighbours. A friend or two may have died in this time - but most of my old friends are still around. Life is good & my love for my wife continues to grow!
