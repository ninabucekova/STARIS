			 I am still happily married & we're both in good health - our children have now left home & we have time for ourselves & doing what we want. Both families live locally so we're able to spend plenty time with them & also grandchildren. I've stopped working & look after the grandchildren for part of the week to reduce child-care costs. I also attend a patchwork class & go swimming during the week. My husband now only works part time so this lets us take our holidays throught the year, avoiding school holidays which is a novelty for us. We both still have our interest in the theatre & enjoy our outings there. Although we enjoy each others company it's nice to have the whole family together at every opportunity, although it can be tiring.
