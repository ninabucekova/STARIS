			 Now that my children are all grown-up I am still playing tennis and enjoying my other hobbies which are cooking sewing, cinema and going to see live shows and concerts. I am still visiting the little village in {PLACE South West England} where I have been on holiday since I was a child and where I meet up with my brothers who live abraod. I am working part-time as a receptionist as I enjoy meeting new people and get pleasure from being helpful to others. I like to think I am fairly healthy despite a few aches and pains!
