			 I imagine my life at 60 to be similar in many ways as it is now. My health may have deteriorated more, which will prevent me from doing some of the things I like to do. I hope to still be able to travel and see places I have always wanted to go. I hope to still play just as pivotal a role in my Childrens lives and grandchildrens lives as I do now. I would like to think that I am able to do some type of voluntary work as health permits. My home and family are still the most important thing in the world to me, as are my friends both old and new, I still read avidly about a wide range of topics and will always continue to be interested in current affairs and world issues. I hope life is still as exciting, interesting and full of opportunities.
