			 Positive version: I will have found a loving and supportive partner who will live with me. We will be working part-time or self employed so that work does not dominate our lives. We will have foster children or neices, nephews etc to stay at weekends. We will also have enough leisure time to explore parts of England Wales etc together for long weekends away. My back problem will be under control & I will not have constant pain in my neck & shoulders. Negative version: I will still have constant pain in my neck & shoulders I will still be lonely but making the best of it (as now) I will be fat and have diabetes or some other condition relating to my stomach or blood sugar. My lower back problem will get worse. I will not feel accepted or valued in this market town (or another I have moved to) to start afresh i.e. my plans will not work out. I will be doing a job where I don't feel valued enough (as now)
