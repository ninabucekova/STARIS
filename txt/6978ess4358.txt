			 I expect to still be working part - time and helping out my daughters with their young children so they can also work part-time. As my dog will no doubt have passed away I will joing an over '50's' dance or exercise class to keep active. I still hope to ride again & learn to ski before I get to 60. Health wise I expect the odd niggles I get in my shoulder & knee to get worse but to be in general good health.
