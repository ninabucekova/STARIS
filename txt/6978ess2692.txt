			 My family have all grown and are all happy and fulfilled with their lives. I live in a nice comfortable home. My husband has a part time job he enjoys & enjoy regular holidays. Possibly thinking of joining my daughter who lives in New Zealand. I now continue to work as a part time nurse, because I want to, not because I have to! My health continue's to be good, also that of my husband, we continue to be really active & social life is good. Life is certainly good!! looking forward to the next 10yrs!
