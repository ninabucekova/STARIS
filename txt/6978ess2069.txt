			 I would like to think that I would not still be working and have sufficient money to travel at home and abroad possibly even living abroad. I hope my health will still be very good and I continue to go to the gym, swim & walk a lot. I will still read a lot, probably more than I do now due to having extra free time. I will still be married and living with my husband on our boat.
