			 I love going for a walk each day, and going on my bicycle rides. I see my girl friends regularly, we go out for lunch or tea and have a loud girly time. My husband & I have a great time travelling all over, particularly visiting our two fantastic sons. I at long last have visited Australia. I am fit and well, probably now doing some voluntary work as hopefully I will have retired. My only concern would be how I will be able to care for my parents when I don't live near them.
