			 The potential scenarios, dependent on the state of my health and that of my parents ... 1) I am living in New Zealand, working full time for the probation service and enjoying reasonable health. Out of work I am travelling around the country visiting friends and meeting new people; or travelling to Australia for holidays. I like to watch sport, go to the cinema, theatre and see live music. 2) I am living in the U.K., near the coast (ideally) and continuing to work full-time for a charitable or caring organisation. I'm in OK health but probably having some hip problems. I visit friends and family regularly, sharing the care of my elderly parents. I like travelling abroad, watching sports and going to the cinema, theatre and live bands with friends.
