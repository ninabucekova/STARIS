			 I imagine I will be doing a similar job although maybe in a more managerial, less 'hands on', capacity. I hope to be working more from home and less in an office. I imagine my home life to be stable possibly with a partner. I hope that my health continues to be good and that I am still able to go to the gym 3 times a week as now.
