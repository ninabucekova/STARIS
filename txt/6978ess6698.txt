			 Now I am sixty, I still lead a busy active life. I have slowed down a little but keep busy working in the garden and working outside I am still busy teaching & practising tai Chi and meditation. I try to keep my mind active by reading and writing and am involved in plenty of online activities. Whenever I can I go travelling during the winter months to get some winter sunshine & cultural input. I am involved in a number of local groups & voluntary work and still regularly enjoy playing music with friends.
