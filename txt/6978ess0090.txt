			 I imagine at 60 I'll be doing the same as now only itâ€™s going to take longer to get each job done. In my experience farmers & their wives in the {PLACE British Isles} don't stop they just get older & slower. In my imagination I have my garden under control & the pond landscaped & finished with luck I might even have redecorated the house & been on one or two more "good" holidays with {HUSBAND}. So far we've only had 3. 1. Honeymoon 2. 25 yrs Silver Wedding 3. 30 yrs Pearl wedding. My son's will be happy & settled & with lukh all of us will be in as good health as we are now!!
