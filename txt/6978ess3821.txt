			 When I am sixty, I hope I am still working cos I enjoy my job at {WORKPLACE courier}, and being with people. I intend to be swimming, taking a pilates class and keep fit sessions, which I do now. My home life is busy with friends, which I continue to see, and visit from time to time. Not forgetting my health which I hope will be good.
