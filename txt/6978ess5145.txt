			 I am retired now but occassionally help out at local voluntary organisations. I am enjoying having the time to enjoy Life's simple activities such as walking & pottering in the garden, visiting friends regularly. Spending time with my family gives me great pleasure - how wonderful not to have to try to fit everything in around a full-time job. I keep myself active & am concerned about remaining fit, I still take the attitude of money is not everything! which still continues to irritate my husband! some things never change!!
