			 MY HEALTH IS FINE AND I PERCEIVE it to stay that way. I enjoy my homelifeâ€¦ mainly because I live alone (I would be a very sociable person, if it did not involve other people). I have worked hard for long hours and studied hard to get where I am and in return I have travelled to all the countries I love many times over. Overall, I'm happy with my life!
