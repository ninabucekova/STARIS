			 I have retired (at 60) and have more time to spend doing things I enjoy - gardening, cooking, travelling, cycling, walking the dog. I have a full and happy life, although my arthritis continues to limit some of the things I do. I would like to be able to read, but my eyesight prevents me from doing so for more than a few minutes (pretty much as it does now).
