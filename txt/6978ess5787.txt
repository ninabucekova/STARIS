			 If my plan is on track I should retire this year although I shall probably continue to do some part time work paid & unpaid. If the above happens I'll have more time to play golf, go fishing with friends and enjoy the garden; I'd also hope to be fit enough to ski for a couple of weeks per year. At home I suspect we will have a number of grandchildren to add to those we already have in NZ & Australia. If we have paid off the mortgage and have enough money we would both like to spend sometime travelling the world.
