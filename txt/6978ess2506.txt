			 I hope that I will still be relatively healthy and enjoying life, but equally I recognised that I may well be dead. I hope thay I will still be working steadily and enjoying my work.

Hopefully I will still be married to my beloved wife {WIFE}, and I really really really hope that her health will not have deteriorated. I might even have finished renovating the house. I doubt very much that I will still be able to ride my motorbike, even with two hip replacements.
