			 HAVING HAD BREAST CANCER, I AM JUST HAPPY TO REACH 60. I HOPE I AM FIT AND WELL AND HAVE SUFFICIENT MONEY TO TRAVEL AND ENJOY GOING TO RESTAURANTS. I HOPE I CAN STILL PLAY TENNIS AND GO TO YOGA CLASSES. I ALSO WANT TO BE DOING CHARITY WORK AND HELPING OUT MY FRIENDS WHO ARE NOT AS FIT. I OBVIOUSLY WANT MY HUSBAND TO BE FIT AND ABLE TO SHARE IN OUR ACTIVITIES. I MIGHT EVEN TAKE UP GOLF!
