			 I retired from the fire service at 55. I have worked in risk assessment for the last 5 years. earned enough money to completely retire at 60. I will be looking to take 4-5 Holidays per year at home and abroad. carry out DIY at home and possibly childrens homes even looking after grandchildren. My health will be O.K. good at my age to allow me to do what I want to do. As I have been able to retire with a good pension at 55 and mortage paid off I have no plans to work after 60 years of age.
