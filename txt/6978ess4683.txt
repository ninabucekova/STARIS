			 Enjoy watching football and gardening. Living in a house with a fair sized garden on the edge of town. I'm sharing my life with somebody that loves me and who I love. My health may not be as good as it was but I try to keep fit. I'm seeing my clients and involved in a few business ventures. I'm enjoying the extra travelling of late and the financial security thats come from the business success and savings accumilated over the past ten years.
