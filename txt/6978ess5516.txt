			 Imagining my life at 60 I would hope to have ceased working full time, but possibly doing some kind of voluntary work. I anticipate being able to pursue the various interests that I currently enjoy-walking, pilates, swimming and socialising. Subject to good health I would like to pursue my ambition to travle & see more of the world - in particular Australia & New Zealand. As far as my home life is concerned I hope to be in a stable relationship, living in my own home & still in Jersey. I have no intention of living anywhere else permanantly, although I would not rule out owning a holiday home abroad ie. France.
