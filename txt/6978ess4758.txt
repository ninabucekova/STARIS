			 Same job - teaching at a University, which I love - involved with my eldest daughter's family? - I hope. Watching my youngest Daughter go to university. Still in love with my wife. To continue to read, write, watch movies, engage with the world of culture & politics. Hope that the young continue to kick over the UNCLEAR & knock down statues ... I look forward to being 60 - what's to worry?
