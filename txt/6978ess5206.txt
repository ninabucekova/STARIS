			 I am a practicing Counsellor, I feel mentally stable. I have finally managed to stop smoking. I work part-time and own a campervan in which I travel around Europe. I have more time to devote to conservation issues. I enjoy spending quality time with my children and Grandchildren. I drive a frogeyed sprite and enjoy sharing interests with my husband. (we have developed a deep respect of each others individuality.)
