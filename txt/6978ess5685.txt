			 Fortunate to be feeling well. Enjoying my grandchildren, but also enjoying my new independence - gained now that both children are happily married and leading their own independent lives & have good health. Still have a dog (or two!) can't imagine life without one. Would like to be a little more financially secure, but am aware that things are not as bad as for some. Still enjoying holidays, reading & spending time with the extended family.
