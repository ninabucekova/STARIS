			 I AM NOW 60 AND LIFE LOOKS SO DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I THOUGHT IT MIGHT WHEN I WAS 20 YEARS OLD. I AM STILL WORKING FOR UNCLEAR SHOWERS AND STILL IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH {PARTNER}. MY HEALTH HAS NOT CHANGED MUCH IN THE LAST TEN YEARS AND I STILL ENJOY LEISURE TIME & TRAVEL THOUGH I AM SOMEWHAT SLOWER THAN I WAS.
