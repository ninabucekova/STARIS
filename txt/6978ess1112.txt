			 60 years young? Still fit and healthy, and enjoy life. We're still together, still happy with each other. I'm growing most of our food successfully (wherever we are) and getting better at growing skills. The garden is taking shape the land and the woods and we've sorted at last the problems with the place. Or maybe we've moved@ Who knows what life will bring. I'm working as much, but better able to juggle demands of work and life and demands of establishing a sustainable productive landscape. Looking forward to retirement  & UNCLEAR whether it will be any offered? Good friends, happy lives.
