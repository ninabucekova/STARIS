			 I have a steady income & sufficient funds to support my lifestyle, interests and travel. I have a fulfilling work life, part-time employed in higher education, part-time self-employed as a qualified counsellor, also doing some voluntary work in that field. I live in a cottage in a semi-rural setting, close to a small town that has a lively community, with plenty going on. I share my life with a loving man who supports my endeavours & appreciates me. We do lots together & get a lot of fun out of life. I enjoy good health & look after myself through good diet, exercise & positive thinking. I have good relations with my 2 children, who keep in touch & meet up regularly. I have a passion for life-long learning, so I attend interesting courses relating to my work & personal growth. I enjoy reading, weekends away, eating out, films, walking & travelling, & spending time with friends & family. In an ideal world, I could have emigrated to Australia by now. The climate & the way of life appeal, and I have a brother settled there.
