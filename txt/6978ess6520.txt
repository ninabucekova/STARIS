			 I am now 60 years old and life is much quieter than it was 10 years ago. I am no longer so much involved in my children's activities as I am no longer needed as their taxi driver. But I am still involved with their lives as I babysit for their children when needed. I still manage the letting of my houses, from advertizing, interviewing, to the day to day managing. I find that painting and decorating these houses between tenants is taking me longer as I am not as strong as I used to be, but I still manage. My house is tidier now that my children have left home and I am not spending so much of my time on housework. I still struggle mowing the lawn but this has always been an effort. In all, my life is quieter and tidier. I have more free time as I am not involved in my children's clubs any more. But family is still very important to me and we meet often.
