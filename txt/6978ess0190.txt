			 I am still reasonably healthy and still enjoy my holidays especially with our beautiful granddaughter. Life is still sometimes a bit mundane especially with a lack of funds to pursue my many interests. I have a wonderful supportive husband whom I love very much; I wouldn't change that aspect of my life. I have a moderate form of Diabetes which sometimes makes me very tired but overall I think I have done quite well.
