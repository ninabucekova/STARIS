			 I still work part time (three days a week). I do gardening regularly & walk sometimes but not as often as I did when my husband was younger. I love reading & spend lots of time doing just that. I'm getting a bit stiffer in the joints now & don't feel that I have the energy quite as much as I had ten years ago. I am beginning to look forward to retirement in five years time. As a dispensing optician for the last forty years I have seen lots of changes in optics & not all for the better. I feel more settled now then I did when we first moved to Scotland, more at home & one of the locals now. I still feel, sometimes, that I would like to move back south & may very well when anything happens to my husband, providing I out-live him of course!! The only trouble with that is all my friends have either moved or passed away so it probably won't be the same now as it was I will just have to wait & see.
