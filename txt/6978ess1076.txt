			 WHEN I AM 60, HOPEFULLY I WILL BE IN FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT I.E. WHERE I AM NOW. MY LIFE WILL PROBABLY REVOLVE AROUND THE CHILDREN (LIKE IT IS NOW), TAKING THEM TO SCHOOL OR WORK, MAKING SURE THEIR FIRST STEPS INTO ADULTHOOD ARE OK. IN TERMS OF INTERESTS, THEY WILL PROBABLY REMAIN THE SAME AS THEY DO NOW. HOWEVER, IF I HAVE MORE TIME, THEN I MIGHT DO MORE READING/RESEARCH INTO HISTORY, SPACE ETC. MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS GOING TO BE MY HEALTH (AND MY WIFE'S). I HAVE CERTAINLY NOTICED A REDUCTION IN MY HEALTH, SO THE NEXT TEN YEARS WILL PROBABLY SHOW A GREATER DECLINE. HOPEFULLY, THIS WILL NOT PREVENT ME FROM DOING THE ACTIVITIES THAT I DO NOW.
