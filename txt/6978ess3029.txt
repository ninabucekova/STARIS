			 Still working in same job. I hope and expect to be living elsewhere - probably nearer work - hopefully with a new partner. (my current partner informed me last week that he is leaving me for another woman!) I hope that my children will be settled in relationships / jobs. I hope to have a wider circle of friends and better social life.
