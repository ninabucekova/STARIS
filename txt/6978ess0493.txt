			 I am now able to play golf whenever I like as my children will now be 19 & 20 years old. Hopefully they will now be more settled (adopted) so that life will be more relaxed and fun. My husband and I will have time to garden and travel as well as playing golf. I will have rejoined the Parish Council and will probably be on the committee at the Golf Club. We shall be enjoying our retirement! We are both very fit and well and enjoy walking our Dog and Birdwatching, and socialising with friends.
