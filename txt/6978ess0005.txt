			 I AM 60 YEARS OLD, IN GOOD HEALTH AND HAVE A JOB I ENJOY. I HAVE MANY INTERESTS IN MY SPARE TIME, SO WHEN I CHOOSE TO RETIRE I WILL HAVE MANY THINGS TO KEEP ME BUSY. 10 YEARS AGO I STARTED BUILDING AND UP GRADING COMPUTERS SAVING A FORTUNE ON REPAIR BILLS. BEING A QUALIFIED TOOLMAKER ENABLES ME TO MAKE THINGS USING HAND TOOLS AND UNDERSTAND INSTRUCTIONS, SO MOST THINGS BECOME QUITE EASY TO DO ONCE YOU READ THE INSTRUCTIONS. I STILL ENJOY MOST SPORTS. I STILL GO TO LORDS AND THE OVAL TO WATCH TEST CRICKET. I ALSO STILL GO TO CRYSTAL PALACE TO WATCH AND TAKE PICTURES USING ONE OF MY MANY CAMERAS. I WILL KEEP WORKING BEYOND RETIREMENT AGE IF POSSIBLE. TOO MANY OF MY WORKMATES DIE WITHIN 2 YEARS OF STOPPING WORK WITH NO INTERESTS TO KEEP THE MIND ACTIVE. I WILL NOT BE ANOTHER ONE.
