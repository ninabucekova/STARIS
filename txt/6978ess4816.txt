			 I have been "retired" for 3 1/2 years, however, I have still worked one to two days a week in a concultancy basis. The extra income has topped up my pension and has allowed my wife and I to lead a good life. We holiday four or five times a year and try to attend three or four major sporting/musical events each year. This year we are looking forward to the World Cup finals. Our health is good and indeed since retiring I walk a lot more, spend more time considering a healthy diet and have lost half a stone in weight.
