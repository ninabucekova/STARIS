			 I don't expect too much to have changed! Hopefully my children will be sorted out in their respective careers, possibly even married and hopefully living away from us! I expect to be still working within my career. I hope my health is still as good as it is now. I will still be riding motorcycles. I will still be mountain biking & I will still be going walking. I will definately be still going to the pub for a drink, providing they don't make it illegal!
