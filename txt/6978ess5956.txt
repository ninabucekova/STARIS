			 TOUGH ONE THAT. ITS TEN YEARS AWAY. NO ONE KNOWS WHAT COULD BE HAPPENING TO THEMSELVES IN TEN YEARS TIME. LIFE IS SO UP AND DOWN, SO BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS. TEN YEARS AGO I COULD NOT HAVE DREAMT WHAT I WOULD BE DOING NOW. I DARENT EVEN CONSIDER WHAT LIFE WILL BE LIKE AT 60 FOR ME. THE LAW OF AVERAGES IS THAT ILL BE WELL ON MY WAY TO MY GRAVE. ON A HAPPIER NOTE WOULDNT IT BE NICE TO DREAM ON A HIGH..... STILL IN A LOVING RELATIONSHIP WITH HAPPY HAPPY GROWN UP KIDS WITH GRANDCHILDREN SITTING HAPPY, PLAYING AT MY FEET. NICE CAR IN THE GARAGE PLANTY OF TIME TO SPARE ON MY HOBBIES CAUSE IVE TAKEN EARLY RETIREMENT ON MY EVER INCREASING PENSION. NO MORTGAGE OR COUNCIL RATES CHEAP RUNNING COSTS ON THE HOUSE. OH! AND I MIGHT HAVE WON THE LOTTERY! SOME HOPE! DOOM, GLOOM AND DISBONDANCY.
