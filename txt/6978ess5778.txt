			 I am a keen gardener enjoying growing & looking after plant life. I enjoy volenteering to help others & perhaps older than myself. I am enjoying my retirement, having more time to look after my husband and home. I am enjoying caring for my grandchildren and having fun with them. I am doing my caravan every few weeks enjoying the countryside and freedom it has to offer. I love taking my dog for daily walk's chatting to people on the way. I enjoy not having to rush around!
