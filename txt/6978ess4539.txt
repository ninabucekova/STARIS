			 I may have retired from teaching, but may still be maintaining my interest in modern languages by having my own classes for pre-school children. I will hopefully continue to visit new places around the world with my husband. I hope my blood pressure issues continue to be under control allowing me to lead a fulfilling life. My sons are all happy hopefully and in jobs they enjoy - we may even have some grandchildren! I will continue going to the gym and swimming and would like to continue learning Latin-American dances. I will continue to enjoy reading and planning new DIY projects for our home. I would like to have a holiday home in Italy or Spain.
