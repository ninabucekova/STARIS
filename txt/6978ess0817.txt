			 I'm still a 30 year old until I see my father in the mirror every morning. Living on my own since my wife left me 8 years ago is the most severe phase I've had in my life. My golf handicap has fallen steadily to 5 but I don't think I'll get it any lower. I still run 5 miles threee times a week and in the same time I managed 10 years ago. I've cut down on my working hours to 40 hours a week. Any less and I wouldn't have the money to maintain my lifestyle. I travel overseas six times a year. Never to the same place twice. I must start putting some money aside for my retirement but theres 30 years left so still plenty of time.
