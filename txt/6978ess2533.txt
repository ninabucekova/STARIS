			 I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I WILL BE DOING WHEN I AM 60 YEARS OLD. I HOPE TO BE IN GOOD HEALTH, STILL WORKING BUT BE COMFORTABLE, FINANCIALLY AND WITH MY HUSBAND. I PREFER TO TAKE LIFE AS IT COMES. NO ONE CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE. HAVING YOUR HEALTH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. I ONLY HOPE THAT SOCIETY IMPROVES AND DISCIPLINE RETURNS TO SCHOOLS AND THE NEXT GENERATIONS OF PARENTS LEARN SOME VALUES AND PASS THEM ON TO THEIR CHILDREN.
