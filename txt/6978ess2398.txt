			 At 60, I plan to be retired or close to retirement, dividing my time between remote corner of Ireland, and London. My sons will have left home; I may be in a relationship with someone, possibly living together, probably doing a lot of travelling. I would hope my health would still be good, and I would be walking regularly and eating well, and feeling contented about life. I would hope still to be planning lots of music & spending time with people who interest me.
