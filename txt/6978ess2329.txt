			 I have been retired from my main career for a few years not, but I have another simpler job to supplement my pension. I have grandchildren now and they take up some of my time. I spend as much time as I can with the Cadet Organisation and like to get away with the caravan. My health is ok and I have managed to lose some weight. I am happier now that I have left the Police Force.
