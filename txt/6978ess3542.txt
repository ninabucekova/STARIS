			 I'm still working, because I can't yet draw an adequate pension. The kids have just finished full-time education that was expensive! If my back is still up to it, I'm playing abit more golf, and still sailing (although that is getting physically difficult). My wife is still gorgeous, and can still put up with me. Remarkable. We're probably still in the same house, unless difficult times have forced a move in search of a job. ....and probably even greater use of computers has meant that my handwriting is even worse!
