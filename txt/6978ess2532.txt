			 I took early retirement at 55yrs and am now involved in other aspects of working, ie. more involved with my husbands' company and doing some voluntary work. We have grandchildren, so I enjoy spending time with them. We have bought our own property abroad, so I spend several months a year in the sunshine. This keeps me in fairly good health. Although the above is my ideal life at 60, I know that circumstances and events can change things drastically. Whatever happens, I do feel confident that I can adapt and cope with whatever the future holds.
