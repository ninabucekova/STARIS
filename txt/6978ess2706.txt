			 I imagine myself at 60 to still be enjoying my job, still (hopefully) able despite my rhuematoid arthritis to look after my parents. I imagine still being at the same church and hopefully re married in a much safer more loving marriage than before. I imagine my now 23yr daughter to be married with young children of her own, settled & satisfied and my now 15yr old son to be in the RAF engineers, enjoying his career. I see life as a 60 year old to be less of a struggle. The hard work of bringing up two children alone would've been worth all the effort it takes & a wonderful bright light at the end of a long tunnel. Life will be good, very good! Because God is good to those who wait!
