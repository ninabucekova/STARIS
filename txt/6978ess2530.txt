			 I am re-designing the garden again, however back pain means I need my husbands help with the heavy work. I enjoy walking and still able to walk difficult routes. My husband is still working, but is planning to retire next year. We are looking forward to travelling more in the camper van. The mortgage is paid off and I am now planning my retirement, However, I shall no doubt carry on with my voluntary work. I am feeling content with my life, but am limited to jobs I can carry out because of my back pain, which is very fustrating.
