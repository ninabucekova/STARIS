			 At 60 yrs old I would like to think that I am able to retire from work on a decent pension, hopefully. To lead a full active life with my friends and family beside me. Be healthy in mind and body enabling me to live into my mid 80's if possible. I look forward to having grandchildren one day and would like to be remembered as a young minded Grandma by my Grandchildren. My own mother died recently and she always kept up to date with fashion, the music world and popular T.V. programmes and her grandchildren loved her for this.
