			 I have retired and am now able to pursue the interests I did not have time for whilst working full-time. I have time to travel, go walking, renew my hobbies of painting and drawing and playing the guitar. I am also learning to play the piano. I have grandchildren and enjoy looking after them and taking them for days out. My wife and I are in good health and are grateful that we have more time to spend with each other.
