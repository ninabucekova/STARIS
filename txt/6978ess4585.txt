			 I am looking forward to retirement at 60 after 32 years in the Civil Service. With a good pension 'in the bank' I now intend to travel with my wife to all those places in the World that we never had the time nor the funds when we were working and having to clear mortgage debts etc. I continue to play tennis on a regular basis and visit a local gym to maintain a healthy life style. I live in the same house with my wife that we have lived in for 29/30 years. My son is a successful self-employed painter & decorator and my daughter works as a qualified veterinary surgeon in a local practice. She is married and is planning a family with her husband.
