			 I EXPECT I'LL BE DOING THE SAME JOB, WHICH BY THEN WILL HAVE CHANGED INTO SOMETHING BARELY RECOGNISABLE FROM THE WAY IT STARTED, 30 YEARS AGO - THIS IS NOT GOOD. I EXPECT I SHALL BE EVEN MORE OF A CURMUDGEON AMONG MY YOUNGER COLLEAGUES & TAKE A SMALL PLEASURE FROM ACTING THE 'OLD FART'. THIS OF COURSE IS IF THEY HAVEN'T MADE ME RETIRE AT 60, WHICH I WON'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD. IF I AM STILL WORKING HERE I'LL PROBABLY STILL BE IN THE SAME HOUSE (OWNED BY MY EMPLOYER), & I EXPECT THEY STILL WON'T HAVE FIXED THE DAMP. I IMAGINE I'LL STILL BE GOING TO THE PUB & HOPEFULLY STILL ENJOYING BEER, UNLESS MY DOCTOR HAS INTERVENED. DARESAY I'LL STILL BE HELPING AT BEER FESTIVALS & GOING TO CAMRA MEETINGS, ASSUMING THAT'S ALL STILL GOING. IF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY IS STILL DOING FREE BUS-PASSES FOR OVER 60'S I HAVE EVERY INTENTION OF MAKING THE MOST OF THAT. HOPE MY ACHES AND PAIND STILL ALLOW ME GET TO THE BUS STOP, & RIDE MY BIKE TO THE PUBS THAT AREN'T ON A BUS ROUTE.
