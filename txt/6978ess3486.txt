			 I am continuing to pracitce in my chosen profession but under less pressure and with the benefit of more leisure time. Financial pressures have eased and my Children are self sufficient and happily engaged in their own careers. My health has remained reasonable and I am able to travel more and benefit from regular short breaks. Fewer personal obligations enable me to indulge my interests of running, walking and gardening. My marriage has remained strong and I will have proved a good example to my children who have forged their own relationships.
