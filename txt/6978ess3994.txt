			 I have been married now for 10 years and I am very happy & contented. We have moved closer to the sea, so we can walk along the sea front every day and get plenty of exercise. I love to sit & read in my garden with my dog asleep down by my feet. I have a quiet life & that suits me, except at family gatherings, which I love. I have a few aches & pains and my asthma is not too good in the cold weather so we go to live in the sun in spain for 3-4 months during the winter months. I do part-time work when it allows me or sometimes voluntary work.
