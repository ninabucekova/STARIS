			 I would like to be working less hours with time for leisure pursuits and looking forward to making retirement plans with my husband. Ideally we would have few financial worries and both would be in good health. Our major concern would be for a 'settled' life for our disabled daughter and that attitudes towards disabilities were more tolerant and aware of their needs. Hopefully the world will be a more calmer place without strife.
