			 I am retired & enjoying the freedom to follow my own interests & have more time to spend with friends & family. My health is good & I am generally happy. I am still married & enjoying shared interests with my husband. I haven't got dogs now as we want to go away more often in the camper van. I am doing some voluntary work in the local community (now that I have the time).
