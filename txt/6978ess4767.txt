			 I now have more energy having suffered with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome since the age of 38. I now have more time to devote to my interests of Qi Gong and Tai Chi and this has helped my health. Now that the children have left home I am also able to go on 'retreat' and pursue my interest in Christian meditation/ reflection. My marriage relationship has improved now that there are less pressures from the children. I don't have much money but that's OK, I've got used to that since not being able to work full-time for many years due to the C.F.S. (including 5 years being unable to work at all 1996-2001)!. I still work part-time which I enjoy, it is good to feel that I am still able to contribute to society. Have also been able to start attending church again now that my energy is not being taken up by my children.
