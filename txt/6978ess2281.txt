			 The job I am doing I enjoy very much, and being in contact with people is very important to me. I have a very good home life and find myself very contented, I have a good family and friends. My only child now is 19, and still lives at home, which I love, she has a good job and I encourage her to do the best she can with her job, as she is very bright and is full of confidence. Since turning 40 I have joined a gym, and I make sure I go at least 3 times a week. Ten years from now I cannot see much changing except older, and maybe a few aches and pains. I do hope to move to a smaller house, but that will be a few year yet.
