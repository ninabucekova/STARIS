			 I have now retired from full-time work and spend time visiting family and friends often. I help out with the care of my grandchildren, from time to time. I have more time to pursue my hobbies and interests. I swim once a week and enjoy having more time to read. I am still quite involved with my Church activities. I do get tired easily and have some pain and movement difficulties in my joints.
