			 I have made my hobby - Art - into a very successful business. It does not seem like work because it is so enjoyable. The hard work I have put into building this up since I was 50 has resulted in a substantial rise in income and with working from home, at something I love doing has allowed home life to flourish. My relationship with my wife and children couldn't be better and with more income and more time with them we really enjoy our life to the full. We have bought other property abroad and in the UK and can afford some really nice holidays without worrying financially. I have looked after my diet and fitness and feel in really good shape. I have continued to write and illustrate childrens books and enjoy teaching children how to draw cartoons. This ensures that I get about to meet people and add value to other peoples lives.
