			 I imagine when I am 60 years old my life may not be very different. I would imagine that my husband and I will be living in the same house and think it very likely that we will both remain in the same jobs, albeit the jobs will have altered somewhat. Hopefully we will both remain healthy and have more leisure time. Working shorter hours. My two sons will be in their late 20s and will presumably have left home. Therefore we will probably not have as many financial concerns and have more time and money to spend on holidays and leisure activities. I would like to have travelled more, both home and abroad. I would not at this stage anticipate my sons moving too far away and would hope to have plenty of contact with them. I look forward to fulfilling more personal ambitions, but mainly hope for good health for myself and my family.
