			 I'M IN A HOME I LOVE. MY WIFE SUSIE AND I HAVE A CRACKING RELATIONSHIP - TOGETHER WHEN WE WISH BUT WITH SPACE FOR OUR OWN INTERESTS. I'M STILL WORKING THREE OR FOUR DAYS A WEEK - DIRECTING SOCIAL MARKETING ACTIVITIES THAT LEAD TO REAL CHANGE. I KEEP IN REGULAR TOUCH WITH MY TWO BOYS (NOW 26 AND 21). THEY ARE COMMITTED TO THEIR WORK BUT ENJOY GETTING TOGETHER. WE PLAY GOLF & TENNIS TOGETHER AND GRAB OCCASSIONAL WEEKENDS TO VISIT EUROPEAN CITIES. I'VE SOLD PART OF THE BUSINESS WHICH GIVES ME THE MONEY AND TIME TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH FRIENDS - OFTEN DOING SOMETHING ACTIVE LIKE HILL-WALKING. I'M STILL WORKING OUT THREE TIMES A WEEK, IN GOOD HEALTH, STILL STRUGGLING TO LOSE WEIGHT, PLAYING GOLF ONCE A WEEK, READING LOTS AND ENJOYING MUSIC & FILM.
