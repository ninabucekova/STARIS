			 I AM ENJOYING WORKING PART TIME AT MY BUSINESS AND THE MANAGEMENT BUY OUT IS GOING WELL. IT SHOULD ENABLE ME TO BE COMFORTABLE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE FINANCIALLY. I AM FIT AND WELL FOR MY AGE ALTHOUGH I KNOW MY LIMITS AND MODERATE MY ACTIVITIES TO SUIT. I SEE MY GRANDCHILDREN QUITE OFTEN SPEND LOTS OF TIME WITH MY LOVING WIFE AND STILL ENJOY MAKING MUSIC AND DIY. WE HOLIDAY ON A REGULAR BASIS AS WELL. LIFE IS GOOD THOUGH STILL HECTIC AT TIMES. I WOULDN'T HAVE IT ANY OTHER WAY.
