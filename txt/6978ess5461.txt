			 All the children have left home. I am doing some contract work / consultancy if something interests me, but travelling & spending quite a lot of time abroad (maybe doing VSO?) and supplementing income through possibly renting the house / a room or two etc. Spending time with family & friends is important & I do a lot. My mum is still alive & I spend time with her (will be computing with being abroad!) My partner & my relationship still good, both of good health & exercise daily. Probably not yet a grandparent. Doing music / drama still. Learning new things too - don't know what!
