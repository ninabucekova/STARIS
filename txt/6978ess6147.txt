			 I am still leading a pleasant life with my partner and we still haven't had a row. We both enjoy going to our allottment and tending all the veg we have grown though we can only do it at weekends as we are still working full time. We don't have a lot of money but we are quite comfortable & happy in our surroundings. I'm still having problems with my feet & back but I still manage to go to work every day.
