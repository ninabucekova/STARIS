			 I have recently retired from a teaching career, having worked more years than I would have chosen in order to finance my three children through higher education. I now look forward to leading a less stressful life pursuing a life long partial interest in farming, by helping in a voluntary manner to manage a sibling farming business. I am living with my wife, having been married 36 years. Our three daughters have all obtained university degrees and secured professional employment and have long term partners. They visit us regularly and we consider ourselves a strong family/extended family. My wife and I value good health and actively ensure we exercise to keep fit.
