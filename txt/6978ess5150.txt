			 I am now working 2 days each week and have plenty of time for leisure activities. Children are now financially independent. Still walking regularly and playing badminton (very limited). Still spending much time looking after the Mum and this has restricted opportunities to visit overseas. House well maintained. Still on medication for high b.p. but this has improved with reduces UNCLEAR and improved work/life balance.
