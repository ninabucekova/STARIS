			 When I am 60, I hope to be still fit and well, able to continue my interests. I like to scuba Dive so will have visited many of the places on my list by now and still go diving when I can. Travel will still be very important to me, visiting places & seeing things, cultures and experiences while I am still able to and have visited many of the places on my 'to go' list. My two sons have settled down and I am now a grandmother and see my family often. I still work part time as I won't be collecting my state pension unitl I am 65! My life is full and I am well and happy and am now living in a rural home rather than in the city.
