			 I am retired and am able to travel a lot with my husband. We enjoy taking long lets on houses in Greeece and spending time travelling around and getting to really know the country and people. In my spare time I am developing creative interests such as jewellery making. I now have time to go swimming regularly which I really enjoy. My children have now both graduated from university and are in good jobs which they both enjoy. My mother has now moved down from {REGION Northern England} to live close by and I visit her most days to check that she is okay.
