			 I will probably be living in the same house with my husband. We will both be working, as we don't have much pension (Equitable Life & Standard Life & credit crisis!), but I will be doing lots of reading and following my hobbies. We will grow vegetables and flowers in the garden. Friends will come to visit more often, since my sons will have left home by then. We will have fun!
