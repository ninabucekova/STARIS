			 I am now semi-retired and living part of my life in Spain, in a home that I own there. I still work part-time in catering - I eat healthy food and exercise and walk often to controll my diabetes (though I belive a cure is just around the corner.) I still love all sports and Leeds are now back in the premier league!! Whether I am still single, I'm not sure but probably.
