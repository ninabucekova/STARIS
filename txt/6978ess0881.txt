			 I am still working in the same employment. My children are working, one in college - still living at home! I enjoy more holidays in warmer climates. My injured femur is less painful due to an operation several years ago - This has enabled me to partipate in more activities - walking, keeping fit. My health generally is good. I enjoy regular visits to the theatre, restaurants etc on a regular basis.
