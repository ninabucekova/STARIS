			 I have recently lost my job, end of contract after a year's immense learning and hard labour. I am not as physically fit as would like to be and have limitations now to the tasks I can do. I still enjoy craft work but limited to what I can now do in the garden, and this is a big miss. I still enjoy spending time with my grand-daughter, swimming not as able as used to. I love being in my family's company thats when I feel relaxed, and loved and needed. I struggle to get employment as suffering from stress creates so many anxieties travelling sleeping and holding on to a post, which is easier in a calm environment. I'm no longer equiped to work in the fast lane and I get scared of under performing as employers compare inefficiency and seek younger employees to fulfill the shortfall I now leave. My inadequacy increases making me feel utterly useless, and more dependant on those around to support my now everyday needs. Future is grim with little to look forward to.
