			 I would hope to be active and healthy - hopefully not working full time (maybe part time). I would like to be more involved with the activities of my church & perhaps other voluntary work. I would probably still be single & living on my own though I am certainly open to other possibilities. I would hope to have a good circle of friends still & continue to enjoy the company of my sisters & in-laws. I would like to write, to visit the country often & spend a lot more time working on my allotment.
