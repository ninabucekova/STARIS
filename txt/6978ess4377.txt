			 I expect I'll still be living in same house, either alone or caring for elderly parent. Still leading very similar life to now but expect to have more aches & pains! Hope to still be working in some line of work but expect "age" will bring greater risks of redundancy. Hope to have found time/courage to get out and try new things & visit new places. Expect the world will be a different place ....probably not better!
