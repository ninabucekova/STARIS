			 At 60 years old I imagine I will still be living in the same village. I will most likely be living in a different house, having sold the one im in at present and purchased a smaller one that I could possibly extend and renovate. I will be with my wife, my children will most likely now have left home. I hope that I will have the same circle of friends and socialise much the same as I do now. I hope that I will still be in good health and doing the same job, but possibly reduce the amount of hours I now work. I hope my children will be persuing their own desired careers and be both happy and healthy.
