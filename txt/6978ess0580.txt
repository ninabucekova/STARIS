			 My partner and I have retired to {COUNTRY1, Europe}. We live on the coast as we both enjoy swimming and coastal walks, and love the food & mediteranean lifestyle. Our families can visit frequently as {PLACE, COUNTRY1} airport is only a short drive away. We have been here for seven years so are pretty settled now. I have done some nursing work since leaving the UK, both for the nursing agencies, & also for a local GP's surgery here in {COUNTRY1}. My health is good. After a back injury at 50 years old I did a complete health review & began to really look after my health again - taking time out to exercise regularly. Complete revamp my diet as my cholesterole had raised a little and taking time to rest properly too. I learned to focus on what was good for my life, to get me from A to B as healthily & happily as possible & at 60 it has brought me to a happy retirement in the sun!
