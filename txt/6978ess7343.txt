			 We have a second home, a flat in {PLACE Scotland}, in the Cairngorms National Park. This was a lifestyle decision by my wife and I, and is one of the best choices we have made with our lives. It is something that we both enjoy and provides a break from both work and home. We hope that our daughters are enjoying their lives, and will support them in whatever they do.
