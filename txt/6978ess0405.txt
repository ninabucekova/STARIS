			 I am a healthy, fairly active 60 year old. I have retired but am involved with my interests & my family. I regularly look after my grandchildren, read, garden etc. The house is paid off. My youngest Son is settled in a job & living on his own which gives me much more freedom to visit friends, family & travel. I may even have a bloke in my life!
