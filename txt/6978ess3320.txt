			 I love to go shopping with my girlfriends, at the weekend, catching up on the gossip over lunch. Saturday evening, go for an Italian meal (my fav) with {HUSBAND} (husband) have a chat and a few drinks. Sundays: have to have my family for lunch, especially my new grandson {GRANDSON}. Healthwise its good, I'll have to learn to slow down, being sixty I probably will. Enjoying my job of 20 years. Cooking in the nursery for {COLLEGE}. I'll also have the option of retiring (Scarey).
