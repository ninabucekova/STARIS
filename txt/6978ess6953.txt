			 At 60 years old I am enjoying more free time. I work 2 days a week which gives me some pocket money and an interest. My sons have left home and are working and enjoying life. My husband,{HUSBAND} and I like to travel and explore new places both here and abroad. It is good to have the time together again after bringing up a family and working full time for a long time. I exercise as much as possible, attending the local sports centre and going on long walks. This helps my general health and well-being. My back and neck will always be a problem, but I am much better since working less and exercising more.
