			 Health - my physical health might improve as I am due to have a knee operation in a few weeks to repair damaged cartilage. This might enable me to take up tennis and dancing again. Homelife - Our children will have left home, this will enable my husband & I to have more time for shared interests, outings etc. and a fuller social life. I hope we may be able to have some weekends away together for fell-walking. Work - I am currently in my first year as a member of the Clergy in the Church of England. I am working part time on a voluntary basis at the moment. I imagine that in 10 years time I will be working more hours per week and in a paid position, possibly in Chaplaincy work.
