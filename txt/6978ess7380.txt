			 Continue to carry on working as its a good job and I can choose to work for a company or myself and what hours I work and where I work. I am still happily married with lots of grandchildren who are all happy & healthy, (as are the children) Helen and I would travel more than we do now and enjoy each others as we do now. Hopefully we will both be happy & healthy and content with our lives.
