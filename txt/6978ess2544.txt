			 Now its just my husband and I at home. The boys are leading their own lives and I'm looking forward to becoming a granny. I'm still working P/T at school and it's keeping me young. My husband has retired and we spend more time together on our own and socialising with friends. I have a few more aches and pains but thankfully, my health is fine. I stopped smoking and feel so much better. I still read and potter in the garden.
