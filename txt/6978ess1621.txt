			 60's, Retirement is iminent or here! Looking forward to a life free of restraints. Children both happily married and settled with their partners financially secure and fullfilled in their careers. Mortage paid off or nearly. Holidays iminent - A trip to Australia for 4-6 weeks taking lots of time to walk & explore leisurelly - (Lots of hiking & long days of walking in the hills around Britain). Perhaps a grandmother - and hopefully active in the community, neighbours, friends, works colleagues - Pass-on hopefully wisdom and values to the next generation & support for our daughters in all they do. I will hopefully be thinner, still attending the gym regularly and still very active in my 60's.
