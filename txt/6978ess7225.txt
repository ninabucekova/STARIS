			 I have recently retired from full time employment and am now working occassional sessions in contraception and sexual health. Now that I have retired I am able to spend more time tending my garden and growing bedding plants from seeds and cuttings. I am also now able to grow more vegetables. As my husband is also retired we are able to spend more time away on holiday and more time at our holiday cottage in North Wales. Where we do a lot of walking. Both children have left home. The eldest is local and married with one child who I see a lot of. The youngest is still single and in the metropolitan police. My health is still good and I lead an active life. I am now able to pursue my hobbies of sewing flower arranging etc.
