			 ME AND MY WIFE ARE STILL VERY CLOSE AND ENJOY OUR HOLIDAYS AND TIMES IN LONDON AT THE THEATRE. IM STILL AS CLOSE TO MY CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN AND WE SEE EACH OTHER OFTEN. I'VE STILL GOT GOOD HEALTH FOR MY AGE, BUT MY LEG AND ANKLE DOES CAUSE ME SOME PAIN FROM THE BAD BREAK 14 YRS AGO. I'VE JUST CELEBRATED MY 35TH YEAR AT THE SAME JOB, AND LOOKING FORWARD TO MY RETIREMENT. MY INTERESTS ARE STILL THE SAME COMPUTER GAMES AND STAMP COLLECTING.
