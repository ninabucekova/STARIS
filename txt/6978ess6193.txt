			 I'm a window cleaner, so I hope to be able to keep up most of my round, maybe giving up some of the harder jobs. I enjoy being out in the fresh air & enjoy metal dectoting up at the beach. I hope to have grand children be then & be an active part in their lives. My wife & I enjoy going on holiday & try different countries every year.
