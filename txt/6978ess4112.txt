			 Now that I am 60 I am happy to still be in good health and aim to live a healthy life style. I enjoy my various hobbies and interests with my loving husband and family, I adore my grandson and love to spend quality time with him. We all enjoy our holidays and family gatherings. I am working away and hope to do so for a good few years to secure our years of retirement, if the firm I am with is still operational I will be with them as an optical lens operator until retirement age. My husband and I love to travel both abroad and around Scotland, and having a holiday home abroad and a touring van we can to both when we want. I am blessed to have a wonderful son who continues to succed in his career and made me nothing but proud.
