			 WHEN I'M SIXTY, MY SON WILL BE TWELVE. A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF SPARE TIME ENJOYING ACTIVITIES WITH HIM IS A PRIMARY CONCERN. FOR MANY YEARS I HAVE ENJOYED PLAYING THE PIANO AND WALKING IN THE COUNTRYSIDE. HE SHOWS SIGNS OF WANTING TO DO THE SAME. I WILL PROBABLY BE INVOLVED WITH HIS SCHOOL ACTIVITIES BECAUSE I WANT HIM TO DO WELL. MY WORK SITUATION IS UNCLEAR, HOWEVER I HOPE TO STILL BE WORKING AS AN ELECTRONICS TECHNICIAN. IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO WORK UP TO RETIREMENT AGE OR EVEN LONGER MY SON MAY NEED FINANCIAL SUPPORT.
