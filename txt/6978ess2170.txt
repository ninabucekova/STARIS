			 At 60 I envisage I will still be married and enjoying holidays and weekends away more often then at present. I will be seeing friends and family socially on a regular basis. I would expect to be working part time (2-3 mornings per week). My children will be at University but coming home for the holidays. I will hopefully continue to enjoy good health.
