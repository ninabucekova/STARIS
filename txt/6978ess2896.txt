			 My husband and I have finished full-time work, we have moved to a smaller house and only have to cover everyday expenses from our income (which includes pensions). I'm very pleased that I had a chance to do further study and now use this expertise in ad hoc consultancy and advisory work. My husband has also been able to follow his interests with more spare time and less stress from demanding work. I'm also pleased that my efforts to get healthier in my fifties mean that I can still be fairly active. We enjoy walking in the countryside and cycling. At last our children are independent and building a good life for themselves - I'm hopeful that their partnerships will make them happy and bring us grandchildren. Some of our time is taken up with caring for our parents who are elderly but not ill or unable to enjoy life. I also have some time to contribute to a local community organisation in a voluntary capacity. We do not have the wealth, or really the desire to spend most of our time travelling the world but we are able to visit our friends and family alot more often than when we worked, including those abroad. So at last I am finally mastering another language and have a chance to use it.
