			 I will have just retired from over thirty years of teaching. I may be doing some part-time teaching or coaching. I have taken up yoga again and managed to lose weight & take more exercise! My husband is semi-retired, and we have bought a bigger boat and are sailing far and wide in her. We are still in the same house. The boys have finished university and have good jobs and possibly families. All but one of the grandparents have died - my mother is still going strong! My anxiety, which has plagued me all my life, has all but disappeared. So have my tension headaches. I am still taking an active part in my church. We have enough money to live comfortably.
