			 Hopefully I will have retired from work giving more time for hobbies, sport and spending time entertaining & holidaying with friends and family. My husband has 'MS' so I envisage having to spend more time in the future caring for him as his illness prgressess. Time will also be taken up visiting and helping elderly parents + in laws with day to day living. I also hope to be a grandmother and to have time to enjoy my grandchildren
