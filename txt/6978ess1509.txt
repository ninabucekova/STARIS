			 AT SIXTY YEARS OF AGE, I HOPE TO BE FINANCIALLY SOUND (HOUSE PAID FOR), LIVING WITH MY WIFE, ENJOYING LOVELY HOLIDAYS, LOOKING AFTER MY GRANDCHILDREN, & GENERALLY HAVING A WONDERFUL LIFE. I STILL WOULD BE AT WORK, HOWEVER THIS WOULD BE "WORK TO LIVE" NOT "LIVE TO WORK" AS A MANAGER. I ALSO HOPE THAT BOTH ME & ALL MY FAMILY ARE IN GOOD HEALTH & THAT IF NEED ARISES THE NHS HAS BEEN SORTED OUT.
