			 I FEEL I SHOULD BE RETIRED NOW, BUT THE ECONOMY HAS FAIRED BADLY, SO ITS LOOKS LIKE I COULD BE WORKING UNTIL I'M 70 OR MORE TO PAY THE MORTGAGE OFF & IMPROVE MY PENSION. I AM MORE TIRED, WORKING HARDER, MY JOB IS MORE UNDER THREAT BECAUSE OF MY AGE AND THE FACT THERE ARE YOUNGER PEOPLE WHO WILL DO THE JOB FOR LESS MONEY. STILL THE KIDS ARE GROWN UP, SO WE CAN GET BETTER AND CHEAPER HOLIDAYS, AND THE WEEKENDS ARE LESS HECTIC, I EVEN GET THE ODD GAME OF GOLF AND WATCH A FOOTBALL MATCH NOW AND AGAIN.
