			 Well I am still alive. My job is OK, I am mortgage free so that has made it alot easier. My condition has got worse as they said it would. My ICD is still working correctly. I am enjoying my exercise on the Wii. My girls are grown. I am enjoying my grandchildren they keep me fit. I am just plodding along. {WIFE} is keeping me on the right track as usual.
