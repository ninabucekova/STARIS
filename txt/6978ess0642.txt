			 I have retired to a rural setting with my husband. My children are all living with their partners in their own houses. We are both maintaining good health and continuing voluntary work although not as much as when I was 50. I sometimes do some supply work and my husband teaches music from home. We keep in close contact with family members. We enjoy the grandchildren coming to visit with their parents.
