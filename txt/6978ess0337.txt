			 I am very much looking forward to retiring in 2 years time, and wish my company had not extended the retirement age from 60. I want to be able to help look after my grandchildren when they arrive. I enjoy cooking and gardening and travelling with my husband. I am so happy that my son is able to live independantly and has a good job and is happily married (he has Asperger's Syndrome). I am also happy that my daughter is a successful photographer and is happily married. My husband of 37 years is still the funniest, most interesting person I know.
