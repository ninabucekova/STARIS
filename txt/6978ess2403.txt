			 I have retired from my job and have more time to spend with family & friends. I have more time for travel and visiting different places. I have always enjoyed singing and have time to practise on a more regular basis. I am able to spend more time keeping fit, which I hope will keep me healthy in mind and body. I am less stressed, and can concentrate my energies on my home and family, but I do miss my work colleagues and the satisfaction I used to get from doing a good job.
