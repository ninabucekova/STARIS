			 My husband and I are living in the American mid-west. I still have a day to day involvement in my promotions company. We come home to the UK every year, and our children and grandchildren visit every year. We still own a home in the UK, and have an apartment in Mussouri. I still enjoy reading, and walk 4 times a week. We go to the theatre regularly and watch ice hockey and baseball during the on season. My health remains good, and I am looking forward to a long and healthy life like my parents.
