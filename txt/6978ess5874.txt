			 EVERY DECADE OF MY LIFE SOMETHING GOOD HAS COME UNEXPECTED. AS I CONTINUE TO PUT JESUS FIRST IN MY LIFE; WHO CAN TELL WHAT GOOD WILL HAVE TURNED UP BY THEN. I EXPECT TO BE HAPPILY STILL MARRIED AND STILL IN PROFESSIONAL WORK. STILL CHURCH FAMILY BEING MY MAJOR INTEREST AND INVOLVEMENT. STILL IN GOOD HEALTH AND CARING FOR ELDERLY PARENTS. IN FACT: NOT MUCH CHANGE BUT ALL ROUND IMPROVEMENT IN LIFE.
