			 I would hope to live in a happy family environment with family and friends visiting frequently. I would like to do some voluntary work, perhaps part-time. I would like to keep fit regularly by doing aeorbics classes and going to the gym, as I do now about 4 times a week. I would like to travel to more cities, go on a cruise and increase my knowledge of other cultures & countries. I would like to be in good health. Both my parents died of cancer at aged 56 and 77 so that is of great concern to me - I amost expect to follow suit; but try and eat healthily and exercise etc. Moderation if the key, I belive. I want to be able to see my son lead a happy and fulfilling life and be around to help and support him in the furture!!
