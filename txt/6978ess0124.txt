			 I'd like to have been accepted for ordination into the Western Buddhist Order. I'd like to have achieved a much better state of mental and emotional equilibrium after a difficult ten years of being a carer (for my mother, who died in November, with Alzheimers). I'd like to maintain a healthy outdoor life style including cycling, walking, and overseas trips to remote regions on foot and by bike. I'd like to have taken up rock climbing and to have finished my Munro's (hills over 3000') I'd like to be able to ski a series of good telemark tours even on steep ground.
