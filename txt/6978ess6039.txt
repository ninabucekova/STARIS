			 I would hope to be living in a smaller town on the edge of {PLACE1 South West England} and joining in local societies and activities. I would hope to be less stressed as the 4 children will be through university. I see myself as having done a Phd in history (which I am applying for) and either volunteering or working part time. I will need the social contact. After 25 years of bringing up kids I would hope me & my husband would be healthy and able to enjoy our free time. My husband is hoping to retire by 60, I hope the children will not be too far away and that we are grandparents. I would hope that we could travel more. With the children leaving home & no longer part of {PLACE1} schools I am beginning to fee isolated where I live now so the main thing at 60 would be that we have successfully moved to {PLACE2 South East England} and are enjoying life there & having grandchildren to stay regularly.
