			 I HAVE A VERY SERIOUS SPINAL INJURY WHICH CAUSES ME CHRONIC PAIN, SO I EXPECT AT 60 I SHALL STILL BE IN PAIN FOR EVERY MINUTE OF EVERYDAY SO, TO BE HONEST, IVE HAD A GOOD LIFE APART FROM MY RECENT PROBLEMS, SO IF I'M GONE BY THEN I WON'T BE SORRY. I'VE A GREAT MARRIAGE BUT MY WIFE WILL STILL BE LOOKING AFTER ME AT GREAT COST TO HERSELF I SHOULD IMAGINE. HOPEFULLY IF I'M STILL HERE AT 60 I'LL STILL BE LIVING HERE - ITS A BEAUTIFUL VILLAGE AND EVERYBODY SAYS HELLO.
