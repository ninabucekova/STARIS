			 As with all famalies, hopefully my children will be settled in good jobs and have moved out, allowing my wife and myself to downsize to smaller property, with a large garden allowing me to buy a dog to take on walks. Buying classis sports car to go on country drive and walks However due to economic crisis, I feel all the money I have put into personal pension is wasted as it is now worthless. I feel that I will have to work as long as my health will allow. Due to my family history of health problems, hopefully I can stay fit as long as possible watch live sport (rugby, football) with my friends. Enjoy meals out with friends, However very unsure of financial future! and whether I'll be able to afford to do things I want.
