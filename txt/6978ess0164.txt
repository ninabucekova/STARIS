			 I would like to think I will be sharing my husbandâ€™s retirement and we will have been on a few long haul holidays, to Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India, hopefully our health will have held up, that I will have kept control of my diabetis. I hope our children will have achieved all they set out to do, perhaps more grand-children. we have 3 already. I hope I still love pop & indie music, and still reconise who's who, hopefully my memory hasn't got much worse that it is now, we should be still living in the same house, it would be nice if we have been able to build a new home in the garden. and sold the old home on. If I haven't stopped work, I hope it's in the same job I do now.
