			 I work full time. I enjoy swimming, dancing and dine out a lot, also I enjoy cooking entertaining friends. My job is very stressful but I do love going to work, no two days are the same. At the moment I live in a Flat which I really hate, but I am looking for other accommodation. My health is up and down at the moment but in general I feel good.
