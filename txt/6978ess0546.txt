			 I am married to {PARTNER} & approaching retirement from my full-time job. This will allow me more time for travel & other interests, in particular working in our complimentary therapy business. I am still practicing yoga on a regular basis. However, I now need to make more allowances for my knee & hip joints. These problems aside, I am still in good health.
