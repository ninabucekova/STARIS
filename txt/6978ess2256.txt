			 At 60 years old I will still need to be working in my job if possible to claim a decent pension. I'm hoping my children are all settled and healthy and probably provided me with grandchildren. I hope I will be healthy enough to carry on with any interests I may have & that me & my partner {PARTNER} are still happoy together and in reasonable health. At this moment in time I still have both parents living & it would be important to me if they were still alive when I'm 60. Just hope I'm not struggling financially as I am at the moment. Keeping on close contact with my best friends will be a big part of my life.
