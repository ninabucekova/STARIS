			 I have just retired from the civil service but now I have a new UNCLEAR job I seem to as active as ever. I am looking forward to many more holidays and spending more time with the family. It is quite daunting to think of retirement ahead of me but I have a good pension and good health so I can be positive It is nice not to be in charge of so much only me and able to relax, but I must keep busy.
