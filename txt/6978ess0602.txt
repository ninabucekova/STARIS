			 Will have a wide range of friends and interests, both locally and more widespread within the country. A comfortable home life with stability and security. I would hope that my health is good and I am able to do everything I would wish without limitations of health affecting this. I will either still be working in paid or voluntary work. I wish to keep very occupied and purposeful, with a sense of purpose beyond my own needs, to the wider community. Overall I have no specific plans for my life at 60, but hope that I can build on the life which I already have.
