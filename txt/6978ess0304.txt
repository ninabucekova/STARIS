			 I continue to live a happy and fulfilling life with good health and a supportive husband and family. I continue to work at college with students with a learning disability or brain injury. I now have paid work as a counsellor and have trained to be a counselling supervisor. I have continued to play saxaphone in a group and enjoy singing also with a group. We have stayed living in the same house. Our sons are both doing well with jobs and are living where they want to live.
