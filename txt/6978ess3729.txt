			 I hope I will be playing regular golf with a firend and also my husband. I hope I will be spending time with my daughters and their families and perhaps babystitting their children. I hope to be able to travel with my husband for holidays or perhaps with his work which would be only part time. I will be pursuing my interest in local history and antiques. I would be spending some time on charity work, raising funds or voluntary work perhaps one day a week.
