			 At 60 I am guessing I will no longer be my Fathers carer and will maybe, have more time for myself. I want to remain in full time employment as the money will be needed to pay for more exotic an unusual holidays with my husband. Hopefully health and fitness will remain steady allowing me to take advantage of so many other things that I do not feel I have time for nowadays. I have many goals to achieve yet.
