			 HAVING REACHED 60 YEARS OLD I COULD WELL BE RETIRED FROM WORK AFTER 44 YEARS CONTINUED SERVICE WITH THE SAME COMPANY - TIME NOW TO RELAX AND CONTINUE TO ENJOY MY HOBBY OF RESTORING AND EXHIBITING AT SHOWS MY COLLECTION OF VINTAGE TRACTORS AND HORTICULTURAL FARMING EQUIPMENT - ATTENDING AND TAKING PART IN PLOUGHING MATCHES WHEN THE SEASON ALLOWS. MY HEALTH COULD WELL BE OF CONCERN - LOWER BACK PAIN COULD BE WORSE AND ARTHRITIS IN MY RIGHT ARM AND WRISTS DUE TO BROKEN BONES IN MY YOUNGER YEARS WOULD BE PAINFUL I EXPECT. CARRYING THIS EXTRA WEIGHT OF A LARGE TUMMY DUE TO A STRANGE DIET THROUGHOUT MY LIFE MAY WELL BE CAUSING CONCERN - AND LACK OF EXERCISE WHEN AT WORK ETC. SITTING BEHIND A DESK FOR YEARS. STILL LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE (PERSONAL) AS WE HAVE DONE FOR LAST 30+ YEARS NOT REALLY WANTING FOR ANYTHING  MORE. WOULD STILL BE ENJOYHING OUR HOLIDAYS IN WALES I EXPECT, AS HAVE NO LONGING TO GO ABROAD WHAT SO EVER - I SAY "OUR" HOLIDAYS, BECAUSE I WOULD STILL BE WITH MY WIFE, MY ONE AND ONLY DEAR WIFE SUSAN. LIFE IN GREAT BRITAIN COULD WELL BE EVEN MORE STRAINED DUE TO THE CONTINUED INFLUX OF IMMIGRANTS AS THE GOVERNMENTS HAVE FAILED TO STOP THEM TAKING OVER AND FAILED TO STOP THE SPREAD OF THEIR ISLAMIC FAITH. I WOULD BE FEELING VERY CONCERNED FOR THE FUTURE OF MY WHITE GRANDCHILDREN
