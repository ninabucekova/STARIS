			 I imagine that I will be active, hopefully taking more exercize than at present. I would like to have completed a doctorate and set up in private practice. I expect to have a few grandchildren by the age of 60 but sadly expect the few remaining elderly relatives to have passed on as their health is not good. I would like to have more time for creative activitities such as painting and writing and hope to continue to have many lively family gatherings. My hopes are that the children will all be happy and not needing any more financial support (!!?) I hope too to continue to be intouch with my friends and to make some new ones. As you can see I'm optimistic about the future but I've been very lucky throughout my life. I'm probably too contented and relaxed and it might help to be more 'driven'. I tend to cope with things quite well and the greatest fear might be loss of sight and independance. I'm hoping this will be a long way off at 60 however.
