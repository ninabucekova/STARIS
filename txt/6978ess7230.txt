			 I try to go the gym twice every week and work out for 1 hour each time and then do some swimming. I look forward to seeing my two children, my daughter is now 24 and my son 21 and spending quality time with them. I go into the office for two or three hours a day to do some mentoring & consulting and to catch up on admin matters. I spend more time with my wife and go out to eat together and or go to the theatre & cinema. We also like to go away on weekends to France or Italy. I also enjoy watching football games & go to the Chelsea home games with my son. Overall I feel fairly healthy & well.
