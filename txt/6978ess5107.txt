			 I expect to be living in {PLACE1 South West England}. I will still be married to {WIFE}. {DAUGHTER1}, our oldest daughter will be 28 and a qualified Medical doctor. {SON} our son will be 25 and probably working in the finance sector and {DAUGHTER2}, our youngest daughter will be 18 and taking her 'A' levels. I hope to be still working for {WORKPLACE} systems in {PLACE1}. There is little chance of early retirement as I don't have a very good pension provision from previous employments. I hope to be healthy and physically fit and still cycling to work. I hope to still have my private pilot's licence and do some recreational flying if I can still afford it.
