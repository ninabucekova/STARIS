			 I hope to be still healthy enough to enjoy reading, knitting and gardening as I do now. I hope I am involved in a lot of musical activities. I want to be able to go out and enjoy both my local environment, and see parts of the world I have yet to visit. I hope my sons are enjoying career/university and happy with whatever relationships they have developed. I hope my husband is happy with work/retirement and that his pension is adequate. If I am still at work I hope it is in a educational setting which uses my skills and where I feel fulfilled.
