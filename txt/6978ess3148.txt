			 I'M 60 AND I WOULD HAVE RETIRED BY NOW IF MANAGEMENT SCUM HAD'NT MOVED THE GOALPOSTS. NOW I HAVE TO WORK AN EXTRA 5 YRS FOR A REDUCED PENSION BECAUSE THE EFFING POLITICIANS ONCE AGAIN ARE MORE INTERESTED IN HELPING THE OVER EDUCATED MIDDLE CLASSES THAN THEY ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY KEEP THE COUNTRY TICKING. IF I'M THIS BITTER NOW, HOW DO YOU THINK I'LL FEEL IN 10 YRS TIME?
