			 A more relaxed attitude to life these days - too bad it takes one to get to 60 before feeling it doesn't really matter what other people think! Now with children through university and two of the three working abroad, life is quieter on the home front but I can now enjoy fulfilling and useful work in the community, now that some financial pressures are off I now take a more direct, conscious approach to looking after my health, and try to get to at least one exercise class a week. Enjoy expanding my knowledge in holistic Therapies and have taken advantage of my 'recycled teenager' status to enrol on one or two courses. Happy enough!
