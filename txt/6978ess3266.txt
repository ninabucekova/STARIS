			 I have various interests including drama, tennis, swimming, walking, languages and playing the piano. My son is at university and has therefore just left home. I have more time on my hands to pursue my interests. My husband is still enjoying his work, and pursuing his interests, some of which coincide with mine. My health is fine, although I have osteoporosis so try & keep as active as possible to keep fit & good for the bones. I am still writing & doing my marketing and also teaching French - all part-time and some of it voluntary.
