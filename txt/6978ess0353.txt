			 10 years time doesn't seem too long a time off. Interests - Share more time/experiences with my wife, travel more as my 2 boys will be old enough to leave. Continue my interest in golf and garden projects. Home Life - Happily married, two boys grown up, moved house. Health and Well being - Health hopefully fairly good, continuance of the stability in life which I have enjoyed. Work - Still in work, anticipate working until 65 as boys still quite young. Probably in present career.
