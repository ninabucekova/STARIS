			 At 60 I hope I will be able to retire from my full time work as a nurse. I hope I will be able to enjoy good health and exercise regularly. Walk with the dog, possibly have 2 dogs! Keep the garden well cared for. Grow more vegetables from seeds. I hope our mortgage will be paid off and I have enough money to keep a car on the road. I would like to think I would have enough money to buy a sports car for myself! (My bit of fun.) I hope my children will be settled, possibly married and have their own children, (Grandchildren for me?) I hope my son will have forgiven me (for the divorce) and that our relationship is good. I hope my parents will still be alive so I can visit them more frequently. I hope I will be able to travel more, visit Scotland and other parts of England. If I had to work then only part-time!
