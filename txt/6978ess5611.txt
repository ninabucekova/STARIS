			 My family are very loving and supportive, and visit regularly. I am still doing part time work. I am keeping a tight reign on my money, (buying things for birthdays, christmas earlier). I am reading a lot more, hence more time to relax. I am getting more pain in my legs, and I have arthritis. And my eyes are still bad (still wearing my glasses). And I have still got my red hair.
