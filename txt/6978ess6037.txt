			 I WOULD LIKE TO BE RETIRED AND ENJOY GOOD HEALTH. MY DAYS WOULD BE SPENT DOING THINGS THAT I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO BUT NEVER HAD SUFFICIENT TIME TO DO - CYCLING, WALKING, SWIMMING, READING, BAKING. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO DO VOLUNTARY WORK, SAY ONCE A WEEK, PREFERABLY WITH ANIMALS. I WOULD ENVISAGE LIVING A VERY QUIET LIFE WITH MY HUSBAND (AND HOPEFULLY SOME PETS); NOT NECESSARILY IN ENGLAND.
