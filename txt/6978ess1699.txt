			 I AM FIT & HEALTHY WITH A GOOD OUTLOOK ON LIFE. MY MORTGAGE IS PAID AND I HAVE NO MONEY WORRIES BUT I WISH I COULD AFFORD A BETTER STANDARD OF LIVING. I WANT TO SEE MORE OF THE WORLD AND LOOK FORWARD TO DOING MORE TRAVELLING/EXPLORING. I STILL LIKE LISTENING TO MY VARIES MUSICAL TASTE - MY INTEREST IN POP MUSIC MUST SEEM ODD TO THE YOUNGER GENERATION. I WISH I HAD SONS/DAUGHTERS & GRANDCHILDREN TO SHARE MY JOY OF LIVING WITH, I AM GLAD I AM RETIRED - I'VE WORKED HARD THROUGHOUT MY WORKING LIFE - I ENJOY REAPING THE BENEFITS OF EARNING MY LIVING TO ENABLE ME TO FINANCIALLY SUPPORT MYSELF AND DESERVE HAVING THE TIME TO DO WHAT I WANT.
