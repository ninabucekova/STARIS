			 I hope to be seeing a bit more of the country I live in by travelling to different places. I hope to be financially secure and still working. Hopefully I will be in good health and able to look after myself. I wouldn't want to have to rely on anyone or having anyone relying on me. I would like time to choose what I would like to do and reflect on my life and do all of the things that I haven't had time to fit in.
