			 I'm officially retired but working part-time and doing a day a week of voluntary work. My health is reasonably good - I swim regularly and have UNCLEAR stopped smoking! We travel abroad to Spain once or twice a year and generally enjoy a good standard of living. I spend time with grandchildren and sons and with my wife {WIFE}'s family. Many of my friends are also retired so we get together for short breaks in the UK and socially in London. My interest haven't changed much - I like entertaining, the UNCLEAR and theatre. {WIFE} and I cycle locally and are active at the weekends. I do most of the gardening and now more of the cooking & housework as {WIFE} still works 3 or 4 days a week.
