			 Hopefully my husband will still be alive. However I do not expect the arthritis in my back and hands to get better, so I am 60 and feeling fed up with being disabled. I had to lose two toes on my feet a couple of years ago, because of my diabetes. My marriage is still strained as my husband feels more like a carer than a partner. I have lost all contact with my few friends, as I never have the energy to go out. I am very worried about my 3 sons, and how they will cope when I die, although I am trying to be optomistic that they will be happy and healthy.
