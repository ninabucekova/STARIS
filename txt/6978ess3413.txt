			 I would expect to follow my current interests : Golf at least 2 times a week. Flying (Private Pilot) and Scuba diving UK and abroad. I would like to be retired maybe with some part time work. Still fit and well hopefully and getting more regular exercise cycling or walking, maybe even start playing tennis again. Other than that a quiet and happy life at home.
