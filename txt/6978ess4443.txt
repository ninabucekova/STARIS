			 Semi retired traveling in the caravan lots of walking and exploring new places. Children independant and lovely to visit and entertain when I'm at home, enjoying more time spent with friends and time to read more. Still working in care but only on a relief basis. My health is pretty good, just got to watch my knees keep the weight off.
