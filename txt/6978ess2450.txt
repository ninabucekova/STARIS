			 I hope that I'm still here! My 3 children will have left home and I'll be a grand-parent. I may be on the point of retiring - it all depends. We'll have left this house & downsized maybe here or abroad. We have a dream of a small house in northern Portugal by the Atlantic. Perhaps this will be realised. Anyway I hope to be spending more time on creative interests that have been neglected for far too long! In the main I'm looking forward to this decade.
