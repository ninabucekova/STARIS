			 I would like my life to be similar to now, having made the move to the country last year. I hope that the next 10 yrs and more will bring more of the same. Good health and well being, same good friends and neighbours, enjoying my surrounding, still working but maybe a bit less. If my husband's business ideas take off - working for / with him.
