			 I am pleased to say that I still enjoy keeping fit, about two or three times a week, which certainly give me a focus. Life is certainly different without the boys at home but we still keep in touch regularly and it's great to see them on a monthly basis. My wife and I tend to make a point of getting to see a show or a film and eating out regularly. The opportunity to holiday outside of the main holidays gives us much more scope now, and there are certainly less crowds. I still enjoy working on a part time basis and am seriously considering getting involved in some voluntary work.
