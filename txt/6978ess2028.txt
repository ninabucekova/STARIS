			 I have just retired. I have time to relax more. I have more time to pursue my interests. I can at last 'do up the house'. I can afford little extras in life. Home life is super . . . I have a loving family. I have a few 'niggling' ailments, but on the whole my health is ok. May work part-time / voluntary e.g. Barnardos N.C.H. etc. Thank you.
