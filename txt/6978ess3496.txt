			 I have just celebrated my 60th birthday & am planning on retiring later this year. I have one daughter who is due to have her first child and am looking forward to spending time being a grandma. My other daughter is away studying and I enjoy the weekends when she comes home. Luckily, I am still in very good health and looking forward to spending time with my husband and having those holidays & weekends away that have been difficult to do over the last few years; with the work & financial pressures we have had.
