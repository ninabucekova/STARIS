			 My home life is changing as my daughter has just gone to University and is no longer at home during term time. I consequently have more opportunities for a relaxing time with my husband. I will have been in my current job for about 10 years and I still find it challenging and interesting. I continue to walk the journey to work each day (approx 1 mile each way) and my good health permits me to enjoy this daily activity.
