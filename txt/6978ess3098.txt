			 Assuming 60 is still retirement ge, I would have more time to do more of the things I want to. I would be a member of some sort of rambling club and my walking group. I would probably do at least one night class a week and hopefully go to the gym at least once. My children should have left home by then so the house would be a bit tidier although my husband might still be here but I would have more time to keep it tidy. Hopefully I could spend time with grandchildren. My health will stay good apart from the odd ache, I don't smoke & rarely drink I look after myself usually. If not retired I think I would change my present job poss to a shop environment. If retired I would do some sort of charity shop work, as I have done in the past, or perhaps animal related volunteering.
