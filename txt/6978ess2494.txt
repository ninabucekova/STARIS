			 Now aged 60 I am retired and able to do things that I couldn't do when I was working such as travelling more i.e. more holidays and day outs, relaxing and looking after my grandchildren and also spending more time on my allotment growing vegetables. My health is also ok. My asthma is still under control but I have high blood pressure kept under control by the doctor.
