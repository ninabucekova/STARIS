			 At 60, I am still fit and healthy, which is a good thing, as I have 5 more years of work ahead of me; I still cycle to and from work, and am on my feet most of the day. I have now passed the menopause so no more PMT or periods. Evenings are now my own, my youngest child is now 24 years old, and the oldest 31, I might even have grandchildren! I go on holiday more often now that there are not 4 young people to please and pay for, as well as going out to concerts etc. more often. I have been with my partner for eleven years, and we are very happy together.
