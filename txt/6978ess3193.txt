			 I have just retired from the job I have been doing and feel a huge sense of relief from pressure. I want to take a sort of Sabattical for a year to allow myself to really discern what direction I now go in.....and I would like that decision to be one not driven by financial considerations. I own my own home and am in a loving relationship that works for both of us. I hope to find ways to stop UNCLEAR things too much and become more of a "glass is half full" person! I am not as driven as I used to be and feel I am getting the balance right more often and therefore not getting as angry at people and events. The health scares have receded and I am not as obsessive about food and exercise. I would like to get more involved with the parish and still value the community and Parish priest there enormously. I am looking forward to having more leisurely days that are not driven by the 40 minute bell, schemes of work and results. I really hope to pick up some volie work and may look at becoming a magistrate. I am still terrified of illness and death. I still hate computers!
