			 I would like to think I would be retired from full time employment. My interests will be travelling & DIY (cars/home/garden). I will be married to my wife (for 35 yrs) and living in my current house. I will probably have to have a bypass operation in my 60's due to de-generative arterial condition. I will be a grandparent and will enjoy supporting my family in all manners. I will continue with voluntary work for the UNCLEAR.
