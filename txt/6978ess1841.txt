			 I have two healthy daughters who are very fulfilled in their lives/careers. I have a husband who is a loving and supportive partner, and happy in his work. I have a successful business in wedding portrait, and interior photography, and the successful publication of a book. I am fit and healthy and have enough energy for both my family and my career. I am living in my dream home - an old place in the country. I have an old place in {COUNTRY Europe} where we can retreat every so often!
