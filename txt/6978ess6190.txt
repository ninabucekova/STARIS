			 I continue to be active, still running & attending my running club. I will still have the same close group of friends who I socialise with and have 'girly' days out & weekends away. I hope I am in a happy relationship & continue to have good health which allows me to do all the things I want to do. At 60 I hope I can start to think about retiring from work but being financially secure.
