			 I find it very difficult to look ten years ahead. I have taught myself to try to deal with things day to day as the result of my difficulties recently. I would hope that in ten years time I will enjoy generally good health. Perhaps be a grandmother and have written a book and have a home of my own again and be financially Stable. Maybe I will be lucky enough to find a new partner to share things with - to cook for and to love.
