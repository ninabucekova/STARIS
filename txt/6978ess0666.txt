			 Interests would hopefully remain the same season ticket for my football team, bingo, reading & crosswords (health permitting) Possibly still in the same job - due to convenience & salary.

I hope to be in same kind of relationship - have been divorced now for 4 years & although I have a new partner we live seperately - I do not want to remain on my own for the rest of my life.
