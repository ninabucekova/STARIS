			 My husband has now retired and we are now able to enjoy more leisure time together. Thanks to my husband having had a good well-paid job and shrewd investments money is not an issue for us. I have been a full-time housewife since 1985. We look after our grandchildren some days during the week and still frequent the gym/ health club although we have more aches and pains now so have to take things a little easier. We enjoy frequent holidays and spend a lot of time at our secod home in Spain although we miss our family whilst we are there. My parents are still alive but as they're now in the late 80's I have a lot more responsibility towards them.
