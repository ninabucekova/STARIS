			 I HOPE I'VE STILL GOT MY GOOD HEALTH. TO SEE MY DAUGHTER GROW INTO A GOOD YOUNG LADY. TO SEE MY GRANDSON BECOME A HAPPY PERSON WITH MY SON AND HIS WIFE {DAUGHTER-IN-LAW} STILL IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER. I WOULD HAVE BY THEN SOLD MY HOME AND STARTED TRAVELLING BY CARAVAN OR MOTORHOME, WORKING PART-TIME TEMPORARY WORK. ON HOT SUNNY SUMMER DAYS, I WOULD BE FLY-FISHING FOR TROUT OR ON A BEACH FISHING FOR BASS. I DON'T THINK I'LL HAVE A LADY FRIEND BUT YOU NEVER NO!
