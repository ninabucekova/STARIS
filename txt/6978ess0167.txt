			 I hope my life at 60 is still very similar to the life I am now leading at 50. My interests hopefully would still be the same health permitting. Hopefully I will still be married, and will be looking forward to family life around my grandchildren, wife & forthcoming retirement. Because I look after myself, I hope health wise I should be fit & well. Financially at 60 I will be able to retire early, and are expecting to be still in full time work, health permitting.
