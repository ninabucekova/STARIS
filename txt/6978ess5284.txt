			 I'M DOING PRETTY MUCH WHAT I DO NOW - I'M A FREELANCE WRITER & CAN'T IMAGINE STOPPING. IDEALLY I'D BE LIVING WITH MY PARTNER IN NEW YORK (HE'S AMERICAN & LIVES THERE) BUT REALISTICALLY I'LL STILL BE PUTTING UP WITH A LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP (HE'S WORTH IT!) I'D LIKE TO THINK I'LL FINALLY BE DEBT FREE & PERHAPS HAVE A COUPLE OF NOVELS OUT. I'D LIKE TO HAVE LOST WEIGHT - GOOD ALL ROUND & WOULD HELP WITH MY MAJOR HEALTH ISSUE (BAD ANKLE & LEG) I'LL STILL BITTERLY REGRET NOT HAVING HAD KIDS (Q20 ABOVE IS BADLY WORDED!)
