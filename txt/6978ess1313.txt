			 I hope at 60 I will still be healthy and active - taking regular exercise - cycling, swimming, walking, ski-ing. I hope to have time to research my family tree - and do some sewing, cooking and gardening. Also I hope my husband is healthy and retired and we can travel around Europe & the rest of the world. I would also like to be retired.
