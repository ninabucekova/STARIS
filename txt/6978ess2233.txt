			 I have loved being a parent, my children are a constant joy to me, make me feel alive, important and wanted. My achievements in my nursing career have gone beyond what I thought was possible for me. I have met and nursed many patients, interacted with staff from other disiplines and learned what they do. Along the way I hope I have inspired some! But enjoyed every minute. I have got to know my husband again after the 'parent years', and found I love him as much as ever. Looking forward to more time with him in the future in our retirement.
