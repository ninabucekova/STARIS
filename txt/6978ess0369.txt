			 I have planned to retire at 60 and hopeflly this is the case, I don't feel that I have much left to offer education now, connections with young people has become more distant. Also the strees in the job is extremely high. Ideally at 60 I would like to see my 3 children, happy. healthy and settled. I would also hope that at 60 I am at last financially more secure and able to do some 'nice' things for my wife and I. Ideally would have the time, money and energy to travel, maybe have a few years in France! Even the Germans have a saying 'Licben si Got in Franzreich' . Still dreaming - typical Piscean!
