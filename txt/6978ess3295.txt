			 I'm still working full-time in a satisfying job. My partner and I are still together and we are both in good health. I'm still fit enough to go running, to the gym, long-distance walking and play golf. My family will have expanded, with my niece and nephew having children of their own who are an important part of my life. I am planning my retirement - lots of travelling abroad, including voluntary service overseas.
