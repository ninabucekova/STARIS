			 Now that I am 60 years old, I am still leading an active life by continuing with my interests & hobbies. I now own my own house and feel that I am financially secure. I have invested for my retirement and have the additional benefit of paying into the Police Pension scheme for the last 30 years which ensures security for myself & family. I am hoping to find some Parttime employment to help top up my Pension & keep me busy for 2-3 days each week. I am still a season ticket holder at {LOCAL TEAM} and throughly enjoy watching live Football. I would also like to continue paying golf and reduce my handicap and help keep me fit & healthy
