			 I HAVE TAKEN EARLY RETIREMENT DUE TO HEALTH PROBLEMS. MY WIFE IS ALSO RETIRED. MORTGAGE IS PAID OFF AND CHILDREN HAVE LEFT HOME. I WORK PART TIME DOING VOLUNTARY WORK. I GO FOR DAILY WALKS, MOSTLY TO KEEP HEALTHY, BUT ALSO TO VISIT CHARITY SHOPS TO BUY BOOKS TO READ. I LISTEN TO LOTS OF MUSIC AND WATCH SELECTED PROGRAMMES ON TELEVISION. I USE MY COMPUTER A LOT, FOR FUN AND FOR KEEPING IN TOUCH WITH MY CHILDREN. I SUFFER INCREASINGLY FROM BACK AND NECK PROBLEMS BUT MAINTAIN A REGIME OF PAIN MANAGEMENT.
