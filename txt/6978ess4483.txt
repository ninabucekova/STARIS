			 I would hope that I will be still generally healthy & able to enjoy an active physical & mental lifestyle. I am looking forward to watching my children grow & develop as individuals. I hope that my husband is also enjoying good health as we enjoy sharing holidays, interests & experience. As our children will be fairly independent by this time I may have begun a new business/work enterprise - it will be fascinating to see how life continues to develop.
