			 MY MORTGAGE IS PAID OFF AND WE HAVE SEVERAL GRANDCHILDREN. I CONTINUE TO LIKE DRIVING INSTRUCTION, ALTHOUGH I HAVE RETIRED FROM MY FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT AS A TRAINING DESIGNER. MY GOLF IS STILL GOOD, BUT AT 60 MY HANDICAP IS RISING. THE GARDEN IS LOOKING GOOD, THE DECKING IS COMPLETE AND MY WIFE HAS HER LONGED FOR FLOWER BEDS. WE STILL RUN 2 CARS, HOWEVER THE WIFE'S CAR IS NEWER. MY BACK IS HOLDING UP AS LONG AS I DON'T DO ANYTHING TO PHYSICAL. LIFE IS GOOD.
