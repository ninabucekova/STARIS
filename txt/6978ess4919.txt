			 I am now retired with a teenage daughter living in a nice 3/4 bedroomed house. My lovely wife cath is still working hard furthering her career. I live a nice comfortable life and am still in good health. I love my family more than ever and we all all very happy. My daughter is just like her mum, very beautiful and intelligent and they still run rings around me! I enjoy working in our modest sized garden and tendering my fish pond in the garden. We each have a lovely car and thanks to {WIFE}'s job we are comfortable well off. Life is good!
