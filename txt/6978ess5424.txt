			 I'm lucky enough to be able to play squash and badminton regularly and continue to meet friends at various pubs and bars occasionally. Having paid off my mortgage a few years ago, I'm financially more secure than ever, and beginning to think about my impending retirement in more detail. I probably have a few more aches and pains than I am used to, but not as many as some of similar age due to my continued interest in sport & keeping fit. I'm likely to remain in full-time employment for 5 more years but I may have the option of going part-time if I decide it suits me. As ever, I have some very good female friends but no-one 'special', as this suits my lifestyle.
