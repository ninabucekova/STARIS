			 I'm still living here, where I've lived now for 24 years, and continue to be very much a part of the community. Together with my husband I work part time at our property investment business, having survived the ecconomic crash of 2008. We continue to enjoy good health and remain keen dog walkers. We see our friends regularly & go abroad for the sun quite a lot these days. Everyone else seems to be slowing down - but not me!
