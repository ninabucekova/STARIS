			 I am a 60 year old farmer living with my wife on the family farm, still working hard. I'm not rich but happy. Our three children have long since left home but visit us regularly with our grand children. I am still putting off having my knee replacement operation but modern farm equipment helps me cope. General health is good. Retirement is on my mind, as none of the kids were interested in farming we might as well sell up soon, which would be sad, but would allow me to pursue some of the other interests that I have such as classic cars, travel and more time for music, so far I've had no time for these. My wife and I have been married for 34 very happy years.
