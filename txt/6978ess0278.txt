			 At 60 I expect to be in a similar situation as I am at 50 - same interest, keeping fit, horse riding, socialising. My home life will change as I am in the process of getting divorced - so expect to be liveng alone, maybe have grand-children but they will live 300 miles away. No plans to change my job, although would like to retire at 60.
