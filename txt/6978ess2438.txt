			 AT 60 I WOULD LIKE TO THINK I HAVE A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS THAT PROVIDES A GOOD INCOME, THAT ALLOWS ME TO WORK PART TIME/FLEXIE: SPEND TIME TRAVELLING WITH MY HUSBAND AND SPENDING TIME WITH GRANDCHILDREN. (I HAVE ONE GRANDCHILD). I AM CONCERNED ABOUT MY HEALTH & WOULD LIKE TO LOOSE WEIGHT & STOP SMOKING. I CAN SEE THAT I WILL NEED HELP WITH CHILDCARE FOR MY GRANDCHILDREN TO ENABLE MY DAUGHTER TO FURTHER HER CAREER & FINACIALLY I AM STILL HELPING BOTH MY SON & DAUGHTER.
