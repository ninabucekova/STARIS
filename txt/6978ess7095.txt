			 3 children still at school. Bit of a struggle not knowing if they have gone down the Private education or Secondary State education. Can I pay/afford for them to get into University plus do they feel the urge to go there anyway. It's a bit of a worry. I hope I will still be working at something I enjoy along with taking regular exercise, (walking, swimming, cycling, etc . . .) knowing heart disease runs in family I am at that age now. Still feeling good being part of a family with its ups and downs but together still after all these years. Will i save enough to get a boat and that place in France? . . . guess I should have been a bit more forceful fifteen years ago! Well as long as the sun is shining I will smile. Still love the outdoor life and working in the garden & chopping wood . . . AAARGH my back!!
