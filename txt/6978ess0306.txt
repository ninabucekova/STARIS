			 I hope to be living in a nice countryside setting able to be achive, playing golf, walking, travelling around the country and visiting other countries. I would have time for my interests in music and reading and that I would still be able to do some part time work supporting teachers and teaching children. My children will be happy and settled with good jobs maybe their own children and they would visit us or we visit them. I would be looking at the possiblity of living some of the time in a warmer climate, possibly in France.
