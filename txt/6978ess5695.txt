			 I am the grandmother of 4 beautiful grandchildren. I only work part-time because I love to spend time with my family. I still feel good because I go to the gym and I do yoga 3 times a week. In our leisure time we love to go to the theatre and to nice restaurants. When the weather is fine we like to walk. We also love to travel so we go on holiday whenever we can. Life is good!!
