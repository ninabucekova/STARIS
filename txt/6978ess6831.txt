			 60 AND STILL NOTHING'S CHANGED . . . I'M STILL WORKING IN AV AND YET, DREAMING OF MY "MIGHT HAVE BEEN" LONG TERM CAREER IN MUSIC! FORTUNATELY, I CAN STILL PLAY MY GUITAR & WRITE SONGS, BUT THE DREAM OF MY YOUTH IS GONE. MY FAMILY CONTINUE TO BE MY FOCUS & BRING ONGOING JOY TO MY & {WIFE}'S LIFE . . . I WISH MY ARTHRITIS WOULD GIVE ME MORE OPPORTUNITY TO DO MORE STRENOUS ACTIVITIES WITH THE GRANDCHILDREN. I FEEL WELL FOR MY AGE & IF I WERE A LITTLE MORE PHYSICALLY HEALTHY I COULD PROBABLY CLIMB MOUNTAINS.
