			 I hope to be retired but possibly doing occasional work to earn extra money. I see myself walking the dog, gardening, fish keeping, washing and cleaning cars and decorating. I hope to be as fit as I am now and not get worse. I'd expect my wife to still be working as she is slightly younger than me. My daughter would be 23, still at home and working but needing assistance.
