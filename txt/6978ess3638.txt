			 I am now retired and enjoying living in my own home. I am still happily married. I am still doing voluntary welfare work and my health hasn't deteriorated to the stage where I have to depend on others. I am enjoying seeing my children & grandchildren on a regular basis. I have also mastered playing the Saxophone to a good standard!
