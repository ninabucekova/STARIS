			 I'd like to be retired at age 60, if not before. I'd like my health to have improved so that I could do the things that I have enjoyed - walking, gardening - I have R.A. I'd like to feel more calm & relaxed and settled in my own body & mind. I want to be more in control of my life. I'd really like to be able to take up a hobby - I've always wanted to do photography / painting (watercolours) - I want be able to have "me" time, go to a health club, be pampered, have a nailcare / pedicure / massage. Be made to feel special.
