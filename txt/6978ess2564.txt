			 At 60 I would like to think I would not be working full time unsocialable hours. Spending quality time with my wife with no money worries, seeing as many Rock bands as I possibly can (with my wife) and having our usual 4+ holidays a year. Spending time with parents (hopefully) and children and grandchildren. Good health would make all this easier and more enjoyable.
