			 Now age 60, my son is married and my husband and I have moved out of the farm house. I have more time for my garden, I help out when called on at the farm. My daughter is away from home and I get time to visit her. I have more time for my friends and like to do a bit of entertaining. My back still aches a bit, but my health is generally good.
