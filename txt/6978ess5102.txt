			 At 60 I would like to be able to work at my pottery which isn't always possible at the moment. I would like to have enough money to not have to worry about daily bills and have a good holiday each year. I would hope that my partner is healthy & we are still happy together, enjoying each others company and caring for each other. I would hope also that my health will improve. I had a stroke last year and although I am still improving my walking is difficult and makes many things I enjoy more difficult, I have been told this may improve with time. I hope they are right.
