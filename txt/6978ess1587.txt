			 AT THE MOMENT, I THINK IT WILL BE VERY UNLIKELY THAT I WILL BE RETIRED AT 60! I DO HAVE PLANS TO GRADUALLY CHANGE MY CAREER SO THAT I WILL HAVE MORE 'FREE' TIME TO FOLLOW OTHER INTERESTS. IN RECENT YEARS, AS A FAMILY, WE HAVE BECOME INTERESTED IN SAILING, AND I NOW HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH A CHARITY WHICH WORKS WITH YOUNG PEOPLE INVOLVING SAILING. AS AN ACTIVE SPORTS PERSON, I TAKE PART IN DISTANCE RUNNING & TRIATHLON AND INTEND TO STILL BE COMPETING IN 10 YEARS - HOPEFULLY BASKING IN THE GLORY OF BEATING 3HRS 30 FOR A MARATHON. OBVIOUSLY I AM HOPING TO REMAIN AS HEALTHY AS I AM NOW - I CERTAINLY DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL CHANGE. OUR CHILDREN SHOULD HAVE LEFT HOME! HOPEFULLY, THIS MEANS THAT MY WIFE & I WILL HAVE MORE TIME TO TRAVEL.
