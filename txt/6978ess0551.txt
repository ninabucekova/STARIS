			 My husband will have retired - Hurray! So we will have moved to a smaller house with a large garden - The garden will have a Goal-post for him & a large vegetable for me & chickens. I hope that I will still be doing some work - paid or voluntary. I will still be part of a local church & will be involved in some kind of service there e.g. social outreach. If I stay as I am I will still be walking - fells in the Lake District are favorite - and gardening & so should be healthy. We will see and support our children & grandchildren as much as possibly - as my brother & sister & their families. We will offer whatever support my parents need I hope they will be living closer by then.
