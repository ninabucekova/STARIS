			 Hopefully I will be retired with plenty of opportunities and family around me. Interests would be travelling to different countries & doing voluntary work in the health sector/research. I hope for excellent health & the ability to do what I want & have the choice to be able to explore and do things I am unable to do at present, due to financial & work commitments & to be happy with someone. A new journey!
