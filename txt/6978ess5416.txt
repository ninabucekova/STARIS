			 At age 60 I hope to have been able to retire from full time employment but would hope to still do voluntary work and/or work part time. I will indulge my love of travel hoping to visit many far away places for longer perhaps than currently possible due to my job. I have many hobbies & interests so will be able to spend more time on these & hopefully take up new interests. I would be happy to be living on my own as I do now but I would be open to new relationships but unlikely to marry again. I enjoy good health but carry too much weight so I would hope to spend more time on diet & fitness when I retire - ideally before then!
