			 In ten years time I hope to be living in the Country, a lifetime dream of mine! With my husband in a cottage with Character and surrounded by fields and lovely walks and lots of space. I would love to have grandchildren and hope they would come to stay at weekends. We ould of course have a few chickens and they would have collect the eggs for breakfast! Life would be simple and relaxing and stress free, hopefully healthy and very happy. I hope we would still enjoy travelling and seeing the world together on vacations.
