I have been able to utilise all the educational and life experiences I have had, to held others less fortunate, articulate and confidant as myself. This I find very rewarding.

Reading both acedemic and fictional works. Being able to relax with a nice glass of wine. Travelling to any any places that take my Fancy, having lovely wlakds in the country and being surrounded by my son and daughter's families consisting of lovely well adjusted children. My health is not too bad as I am able to look after myself properly.
