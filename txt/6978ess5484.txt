			 I'm not working any more and my husband & I are able to do the travelling we've never had time for. The children are now all married, with children themselves & self sufficient! I've been doing regular exercise & given up smoking so luckily I'm quite fit. Just my husband & I at home now, although a close unit - the family visit regularly. Do a bit of voluntary work & enjoy working in the garden, walking & lunches out.
