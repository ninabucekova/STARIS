			 Although now one of the oldest members of my department at work I still enjoy work + consider that I am still learning as well as passing on skills and hopefully also enthusiasm and encouragement to younger colleagues. I am glad that my son now has a career he is enjoying + is happily married tho' I still miss him being around at home. I continue to be involved with my local church + excited by the way God is moving in our community I've stopped my second "job" of baking for the local deli but cook + bake for others as I enjoy it. I still find time to try + learn other languages. My husbands health problems remain the same which does restrict what we'd like to do
