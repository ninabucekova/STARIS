			 At 60 I would like to be working full-time or a good percentage of the week. Both my children will have left home so I hope to have more time to pursue other interests such as singing and playing clarinet (both have been past activities) and to travel both short distance, eg weekends away and further afield. I envisage my health will be better than average that I will continue to walk my dog, pursue pilates classes (as I do now) and other physical activities. At home I would like to have friends & relatives to stay at regular intervals, I would hope to see my children and their partners on a reasonably regular basis. I envisage that I will still be married to my husband and I hope that we are still enjoying sailing and other activities together.
