			 I live in Suffolk and work within the deaf community as a caseworker/interpreter. My youngest son is at university studying (music & medicine). I swim at least once a week (mostly) and enjoy a night at the bingo. Although asthmatic, I enjoy my small garden and often have family and friends around for dinner. My ambition is to visit family and friends in New Zealand and Australia before I retire.
