			 I am a housewife. My husband and I enjoy holidays abroad and short breaks in England. We also look after our grand children in the school holidays. I am in fairly good health although my painful back gets me down sometimes. We will celebrate 43rd Wedding Anniversary this year and we are still very happy together.
