			 Hopefully, I'll still be alive! - I've survived 10 years after being diagnosed with breast cancer and intend to survive a good few more years. Apart from this I am very healthy and hope this continues. My husband and I enjoy walking and holidaying and intend to do more of these activities when I retire. The intention is that I shall not be working at 60 years old, our state pension would supplement our private pensions and we should still have a good standard of living. If this is not the case I will always have the facility to work as a locum pharmacist to earn extra money. Extra leisure time will be used to do craft activities (which are not done now due to lack of time) - and hopefully spending time with future grandchildren!
