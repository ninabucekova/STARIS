			 I will still be working as a Teaching Assistant (I have a mortgage that won't be paid off until I'm 65 so unless I come into some money I cannot stop working) I hope I will be a grandmother and be taking an active part in my families life. I will be fit and healthy. I hope to be having a fulfilling relationship with someone I can trust.
