			 Will have more money, as the children will have finished school (Fee's) also University so we should not have as many money concerns. I might still have my part-time job which I enjoy & one of my collegues is 60 years old. I go and have health checks at the doctors regularly so I will continue, so I hope my health will be ok. My interests I'm not sure as the children are still at home at the moment so my interests in 10 years will be different than to-day.
