			 I am a healthy individual enjoying life on my pension with my wife who has just retired. I enjoy travelling and visiting my family and Grandchildren. I am proud of my children and feel I did the best for them as they are growing up. I visit many friends frequently on almost a daily basis. I have sufficient money to do most of the things I wish to do. Above all I feel happy and content without the pressures of work to worry me.
