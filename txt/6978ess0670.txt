			 I'm am still living in the same house with my husband; we have a very fulfilling happy life. We enjoy visiting new places, such as stately homes, and use the buses and trains a lot to get about. Church life is very important, and our lives are lived in a Christian way. I am a lay reader at our church, which is a very busy, but very rewarding job. My health and mobility are not as good as there were 10 years ago. I get a lot of support from my husband and friends, and continue to be as active as possible. I am very determined not to let my physical state get me down. Our daughter {DAUGHTER} is now 23, and doing very well.
