			 I am enjoying my retirement, enjoying time for my many hobbies, knitting, dressmaking, jewellery making, reading, walking, cooking, and seeking out new hobbies spending more time with family and friends. Taking up drawing and painting again. Spending a lot of time with my husband and sharing many interests together, visiting historical places and exploring more of Scotland, especially its Islands. Both enjoying good health & gardening together.
