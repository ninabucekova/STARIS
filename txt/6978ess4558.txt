			 When I'm 60 years old - I will be retired and enjoying life. I have got good health & still go to the gym. I have got grandchildren which I'm helping to look after & seeing them grow up. I go on holidays to interesting places for several weeks a year & also to sunny places for relaxation. I also go on holiday with my husband in our caravan in this country and abroad. I still attend my weekly cross stitch class in {PLACE South East England}. I now have more time to enjoy gardening - growing flowers, fruit & vegetables. I can now do what I want to do, when I want to do it.
