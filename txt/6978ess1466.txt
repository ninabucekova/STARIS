			 I will be travelling around the world as much as possible if money is available. I hope to move to a bungalow or more modern house that is easier to maintain. I expect to feel more tired, have less energy and more aches and pains, hopefully nothing more serious. I will be working in a less physical job than I am doing now. I will not retire until 65 and get a government pension, hopefully.
