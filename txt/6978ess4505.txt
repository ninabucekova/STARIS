			 I am spending more time on interests such as sewing & patchwork, singing in choirs, travelling locally and longer holidays abroad & lots of walking I have grandchildren who I can see as much as possible. I still live in the countryside with my husband and we have more time to spend looking after our garden and growing vegetables. My husband will be semi-retired from his own business and I may still help a little when needed. We will still be fit enough to do what we want to do. I will probably be doing some voluntary work.
