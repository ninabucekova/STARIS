			 I am planning for retirement asap. My daughter has left home and is leading a happy and successful life. My partner and I enjoy playing golf, taking holidays and seeing friends and family. I still work at least part-time in my present role and my health is good so that it does not prevent me doing all these things and enjoying them.
