			 At the age of 60, I have recently retired from teaching. My husband is also retired, and we are making the most of not having to take holidays in school holiday times. We like to take short breaks several times a year Our children are now 29 and 26 and although I still worry about them (!) I am happy that they are living independent lives. Health wise, we are well, despite the odd little niggle. (Fingers crossed! I remember you asked me to do something very similar when I was 11!)
