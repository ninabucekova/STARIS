			 I would like to think at 60 years, that I would still be swimming most days, reading my books, enjoying visits, meals out with friends, travelling and still going to the cinema. My children will be 20, 22 and 25 yrs when I'm 60. Will my husband + I be at home alone!? Don't know, so many of friends children are that age now and are still there. I am fortunate to be physically well now and enjoy work as a part-time district nurse, I would like to think the same would hold true at 60 yrs.
