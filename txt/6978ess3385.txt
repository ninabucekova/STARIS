			 FORTUNATELY I AM STILL FIT, AND NOW I'VE RETIRED I RUN MORE OFTEN THAT WHEN I WAS WORKING. OTHER ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN CURTAILED SOMEWHAT DUE TO INCREASED (PENAL) INSURANCE COSTS EG DIVING, FLYING ETC MY INADEQUATE PENSION MEANS I SPEND ON AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE, SO DIY IS A WAY OF LIFE AND MY 2 OR THREE PART TIME OCCAISIONAL JOBS, PROVIDES SOME MUCH NEEDED SUPPLEMENTAL INCOME. DESPITE THE STATISTICS I DON'T EXPECT TO LIVE MUCH BEYOND THE NEXT DECADE. THE NEXT FLU EPIDEMIC MAY GET ME.
