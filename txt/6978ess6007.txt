			 At 60 I'm still married and working in the Arts. Although my husband and I remain Directors of our company we work on separate projects - I work primarily supporting young people. We still live in the same cottage although we are seriously looking to down size - one main reason for this is that most of our capital is tied up in the property. Deciding where to move to is a difficult decision to make. We are also grandparents - or rather I'm a step-grandmother. My health is reasonable and I try to keep fit by walking our 2 dogs twice a day. I've also started to do my own artwork again - mainly for my own pleasure but I hope to also sell my work. My husband's arthritis has improved with the new drugs, although sometimes it stops him doing what he'd like to. I feel content most of the time but hate the wrinkles. I had dental surgery some years ago - best thing I ever did! Not afraid to smile now.
