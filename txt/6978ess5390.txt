			 My interests are reading, travelling, gardening, meeting people, learning new skills and languages. My home life is stable but not too ordered. It is relaxed and comfortable. My husband and I are still in love and are good companions to each other. My children are happy, independent and stable and my grandchldren) is/are happy, healthy and well adjusted and visit regularly. My health is good and I take moderate excercise and eat a healthy diet and I'm still a happy outgoing person. I hope I will still be working but not for too much longer - in fact it would be great to retire at 60 and do all of the above, especially the travelling, meeting new people and learning about new cultures. I'd also spend more time developing and indulging my creative side.
