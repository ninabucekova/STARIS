			 By age 60, I do not know if I will be working full time. I would plan to retire/reduce working by late 50's, early 60s. I would imagine I would still be married. I do not know if I would still be in the same house. I would expect still to be fit enough to go hillwalking, skiing and to do a few 10k and half marathon runs each year.
