			 I expect I'd still be doing my hobbies. I'd hope my home would be done at last I think I'd be well - maybe have a few aches & pains. I possibly would be busy taking care of my husband whose arthritis is a problem already I don't expect I'll have stopped work yet - I imagine I'll still be in nursing but maybe not ward work. I don't expect or hope to experience much change, I'm happy with this lifestyle mostly.
