			 Working as a parish priest. Enjoying the progress of my daughter at University and seeing how her interests develop. Still married and supporting my wife's life & career. My current interests would be similar to now - involved with people in Christian networks, enjoying travel opportunities, using my brain a little less & my people skills a little more. I hope to be in good health.
