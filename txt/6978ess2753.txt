			 TO BE QUITE HONEST, I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD REACH FIFTY, AFTER WHAT I'V GOT UP TO. BUT ANYWAY, HERE GOES: I'V STILL GOT MY OWN HAIR & TEETH. I'M LIVING IN A SUNNY CLIMATE. (NOT AN ISLAND, DONE THAT, IT SENDS YOU NUTS AFTER A WHILE) FANATICAL ABOUT FOOTBALL STILL, EVEN THOUGH SPURS STILL HAVEN'T WON THE PREMIERSHIP. MOST PROBABLY STILL ON MY OWN, HOPE NOT. VERY FEW WOMEN CAN UNDERSTAND MY SENSE OF HUMOUR. 'SAHARA' YOU KNOW, DRY. MY HEALTH WILL BE GREAT, JUST HOPE THE BACK PROBLEMS DONT INTERFERE WITH ALL THE GOLF I'LL BE PLAYING. I'LL HAVE A POWERFUL MOTORBIKE. I'V GOT AS BIKE LICENSE, SO BE A SHAME TO GIVE UP DICING WITH DEATH JUST BECAUSE I'M SIXTY. WOULDN'T LIKE TO GO OVER THE TOP OF A CAR AND HIT A BUS AGAIN THOUGH I SUPPOSE, LIKE I DID IN 1978. BUT HEY, I'LL BE SPRIGHTLY ENOUGH TO HANDLE THAT. I DONT KNOW IF I'LL BE ABLE TO DRINK 12 PINTS OF GUINNESS ANYMORE WHILE THE FOOTIES ON IN THE PUB, BUT I'LL GIVE IT A GO. SHOULD BE OK, I DRINK ALOT OF WATER, SO THAT WILL STAND ME IN GOOD STEAD. MY INTENSE FOOTBALL TRAINING AND PLAYING IN MY YOUTH HAS (WITH HARD SKIING EVERY YEAR) GIVEN ME THE STRENGTH, AND TREMENDOUS WILL POWER, AND THE WILL TO WIN TO SUCCEED AS A SIXTY YEAR OLD. ITS GREAT BEING SIXTY, CANT WAIT . . . AND I'V STILL GOT MY MARBLES.
