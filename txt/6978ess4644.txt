			 AFTER HAVING 'MECHANICAL' KNEE PROBLEMS, WHICH BECAME AGGRAVATED BY PREMATURE ARTHRITIS AS I WENT THROUGH MY LATE FORTIES AND FIFTIES, I WAS OVERJOYED TO BE OFFERED GROUNDBREAKING KNEE SURGERY / KNEE REPLACEMENTS!!! THIS MEANT THAT, WHILE UNABLE TO GO BACK TO SERIOUS HILL WALKING, I CAN AGAIN SET OUT AND ABOUT AND GO FOR WALKS IN THE COUNTRYSIDE WITH MY HUSBAND AND CAN TAKE A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN CARING FOR MY GRANDHILDREN AND OFFERING SUPPORT TO THEIR PARENTS/MY CHILDREN. I CONTINUE TO WORK IN THE COMMUNITY. ENJOY CINEMA, THEATRE AND A CONTENTED HOME LIFE.
