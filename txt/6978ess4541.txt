			 I will be living in my own home, enjoying my garden and keeping healthy with a good diet and walking 2-3 times a week. I hope to reduce my hours at my current or similar job as Admin Manager to around 30 hrs to give me a long weekend each week. I will be spending several weekends a year away from home on walking breaks with my husband. I hope that I am still healthy but slightly concerned about my knees + hips and may need to explore private health care if necessary to ensure I can carry on walking. I hope to have been able to have eye laser treatment to avoid wearing glasses. I am very optimistic about my future.
