			 If I was 60 years old now I would be very worried about my future, how my pension will be, even how the law may deal with unruly people. I think I would be scared to go out as I do now, I would never go out on my own. I feel that my life will be harder for me as my medical problems I have at 50 willbe worse at 60. So I feel that there is no hope for me, I also feel that the future for my grandchildren will be harder for them to live Happly.
