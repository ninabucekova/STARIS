			 Now that all the children have left home I have more time to myself. I can have more holidays, spend more time in the garden and spend more time on myself. I'm still fit & well & exercise is important to me. I still spend a lot of time caring for my husband who unfortunately has been unable to work because of ill health due to work conditions. I am the one who goes to work but enjoy this as it gives me a break. What I would really like is to have moved to a warmer country with more sunshine, so who knows I might make this dream happen one day.
