			 When I am sixty my twins will hopefully have just finished university and will be starting to make their own way in the world. My husband will have just retired and we will both be able to spend time travelling and enjoying our hobbies. I envisage I will still be playing tennis 3x a week, still working occasionally as a reflexologist. I look forward to starting yoga classes again and participating in some U3A courses & talks. Healthwise as long as I eat sensibly keep stress function down & exercise I should be as fit as I am now. Life is about balance.
