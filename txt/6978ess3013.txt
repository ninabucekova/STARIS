			 I wil have a teenage boy at home and one child at university so I will need to be healthy and calm, with lots of money and tolerance. I keep up with all the latest trends in music, fashion and the internet as I don't want to be a boring old mym. I have to make sure that I don't embarass the kids however. We will have moved into a larger house with room for everyone to have their own space, and I will have a separate studio to paint in and maybe own a gallery to sell my work. I will be spending far more quality time with my husband and share lots of interests such as walking and cinema. Everyone will be healthy, happy and successful.
