			 I hope to still be working part-time in a job I feel is worthwhile and satisfying. I spend a lot of time with my grandchildren and daughters and am still able to walk and hill climb. I spend a lot more time following my two main hobbies of birdwatching and going to race meetings. My wife and I are both in good health and fairly financially sound. Most of all everyone close to me is happy and in good health.
