			 I plan to be drawing my pension but continuing to work part-time in order to be able to spend time pursuing hobbies and interests & spending time with my wife and our childrens families. I will still live in the same house but be considering downsizing to somewhere with less maintenance. My youngest son will be living more independently of us if he is still alive.
