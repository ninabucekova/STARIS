			 My life could be very different at 60, as my children will have grown up and possibly left home. Since my marriage is not very happy there will be a chance to change things by then. I like to travel and live in different places. I hope I'm not doing the same job at 60, I expect to be working though. I hope my health will still be good, I will take care of myself and keep relatively fit. A lot of what I would like to do will depend on financial circumstances.
