			 I am still working for {WORKPLACE} but have taken on other responsibilities including training, works forum and advising role. I also still sit on various advisory/consulting bodies for the local Health Board. The children have all left home, but I have stayed in the same house in order to accommodate their families. I still play for the community council, and belong to the Amateur Dramatic Society. Now the children have all left home, I have more time to do sports/keep fit, and I also see more of my sister. My mum is in residential care nearby & I see her several times a week.
