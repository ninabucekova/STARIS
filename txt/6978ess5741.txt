			 I feel I have made so many mistakes in my life I just need to hope for the future. Life has taught me a big lesson I feel I have more insight into who I am. I know now that I am a kind and good person I don't have nasty thoughts I am soft and always worrie about everyone else that's been my life. My health has given me a lot of worries but my children are my life and my grandchildren our the future if only you could put an old head on young shoulders I love my family so much and without there help I would be so sad. I know that money can't buy happiness and also that you can't love people to much. If you care as I do, that can sometime bring sadness but most of the time Great Happiness. I wish I could do it all again but I would not change to much.
