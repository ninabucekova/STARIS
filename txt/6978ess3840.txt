			 I hope when I reach 60 to be retired, with my partner, my son (will be aged 20) standing on his own two feet, possibly living away from home. If my health remains similar to now then we would spend a lot of time travelling, both UK and abroad, with finance not being too much of a problem. I would also hope to be married, although that means we would have been together 28 years and if he has not asked me after 18 years who knows!!
