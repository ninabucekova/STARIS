			 At 60 years old I still hope to be fit and healthy much as I am today. Hopefully retired to spend some time travelling. Hopefully my husband will be semi retired by then too. I still expect to be doing some work if not for ourselves for our family. I have a chef and Technician in the family both hope to start a buisiness. I will probably be involved in helping out. I enjoy walking, eating out and travelling maybe doing some voluntary work in hospitals I have recently spent time visiting my mother and still wish I had fulfilled my wish to become a nurse.
