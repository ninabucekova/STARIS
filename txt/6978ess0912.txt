			 I am still working and still enjoying what I do. I try to stay healthy and look after myself - the fitness classes keep me fit & I try to eat well. I enjoy my outings to museums & galleries & try to keep up with the latest music (within reason!) and films. I continue to read as much as I can. My home is very important to me & I enjoy having friends & family to visit. I try to be interested in what goes on in the world - this helps me to have an active brain & a youthful outlook.
