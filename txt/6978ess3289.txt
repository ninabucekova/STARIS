			 When I am 60 I intend to still be developing, maintaining my business. I intend to enjoy the property bought 10 years ago at 50! I intend to have people in place in my business so I can get time to travel. I intend to still be active and in good health. Hopefully my husband who is 10 years older will be able to enjoy these things with me - problem of age differences. I hope to have expanded my social circle as at 50 it revolves around young children/parents/saff in my Pre School. (Work in the U.S is hard with few benefits in comparison to England - the harsher conditions for the working population and harsher social UNCLEAR/unemployment structure is possibly needed in the U.K. These aspects hamper life as I know it).
