			 I have reached the peak of my job, my health is good, enjoy children & family, travel is regular with frequent breaks. I have started to delegate responsibility but the business continues to grow. I worry about my parents & their health, they seem suddenly old. I have found a fulfilling relationship with some one compatible, loving & sensitive. I feel relaxed and able to be myself.
