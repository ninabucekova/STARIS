			 hopefully by the time I reach 60 years old, we will have carried out all of the upgrading on our home as we have planned, and will be settled and secure. As {HUSBAND} is older, we will be retired. I would like to think I will be fit and active enough to enjoy holidays in the UK and abroad, and to 'potter' around in the garden, and in the kitchen. I plan to have more time for pastel painting and craft and to spend some time working with {HUSBAND} on the landscape/scenery for his model train layout which will be in a downstairs room by then (and not in the loft!) We shouldn't have the responsibility for looking after his mother by then - she is 84 now. If my parents are still around, and they would then be in their 80's, we would have to have help, as at 60 I don't expect to be able to physically, or mentally take the strain we do currently. My son may be married by then, but hopefully still live nearby as he does now.
