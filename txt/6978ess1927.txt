			 I would still be working part-time, although may have changed my job and may not be working in the NHS. I may be a grandmother & enjoy a good relationship with my grandchildren seeing them often and helping out with babysitting etc. My husband and I will hopefully still keep in good health and will have had some really good holidays and if our daughters don't come back to live in {PLACE Scotland}, then we will move to live close to them in Edinburgh. I will still keep contact with friends & as now see them often, usually weekly. Will hopefully be able to walk & play sport as I am at the moment, & will have a reduced handicap in golf!
