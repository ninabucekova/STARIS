				 National Child Development Study: Sweep 8, 2008-2009 
		 
			 When I am 60 I expect to have the same interests as now, which are gardening, studying with the OU, travelling, voluntary work with Cats Protection and geneology. However, because I will be retired from work and my daughters have left home there should be more time to pursue these interests although I expect to have pressure of time with childcare of grandchildren and care for elderly in laws. I hope to downsize my house at 60 and live in a bungalow. With regard to my health I hope to be well and doing everything possible to keep that way by regular checkups, healthy eating and gym membership.
