			 I would hope to be retired or working part time, hopefully in a support/counselling/charity/useful role. I would be living in the same house with my husband, both in good health. I would have more time for garden/house/walking etc. and still have a horse and enjoy riding. I would like to think I am more settled and able to enjoy the rest of my life doing more of the things I want and spending more time with family and friends (and being part of the NCDS study!)
