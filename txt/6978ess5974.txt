			 Still working and earning an income although possibly something very different to my current job. Probably less income than now but some challenges and some degree of stress (although less than current). Would like to spend less time in the car and work flexibly or part time. Would like daily contact with a variety of people. Will have regular contact with family although I expect that my children are unlikely to live very close to me. I will still be keeping Fit and expect to be capable of reasonably strenuous activity. In my spare time I still expect to be participating on outdoor activities.
