			 My children will probably have left home. I hope that my husband & I are still fit, healthy & active. I will still be working hard, partly because I enjoy it but mainly because I will still need to be earning money - I hope that the work I do will be less physically demanding than it is now. I think I may still be supporting my children financially though I hope not. I would like to have more time to pursue leisure interests such as walking & playing the piano.
