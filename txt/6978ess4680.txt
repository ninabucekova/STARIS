			 I an still involved in my (quite stressful) job, trying hard to build the business into a sustainable one, to enable me to enjoy an active and yet satisfied retirement. It has been a struggle to encourage my two children NOT to rely on me and find independence of their own. My mortgage is not yet paid off, but will be soon. I will then begin to try and persuade my wife that we should plan a retirement abroad - somewhere warm all year round - not too far, European undoubtedly. Perhaps Greece of Italy.
