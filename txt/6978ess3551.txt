			 With teenage children, I imagine I will still be trying to find IT contracting work (hoping ageism doesn't inhibit this). My interests will still be watching and participating in sport, hopefully watching my children compete at football, tennis or whatever sports they enjoy. I am hoping my good health continues and I am able to keep up my running (perhaps participating in the great north run and completing the half marathon in under 2 hours) I suspect my other great interests of science and philosopy will still be taking a back seat as I ferry my children from one event to another. Hopefully they will be interested in my passion for genealogy. My mental state will be influenced largely but the health and well-being of my children. Having a 2 year old daughter diagnosed with cancer this year my greatest wish is that she and her brothers are in good health when I am 60.
