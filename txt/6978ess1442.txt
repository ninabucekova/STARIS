			 Much to same as now, but poorer. Never have own home, struggle to pay bills and have any sort of life at the same time. Back still popping out regularly (riding accident at 16) knees worn out - wear & tear. Given up Dog Agility (dogs too old & back/knees to sore to sprint any more). Probably take up drawing or writing - something sedentary. Got fat. Still work at boring job - accounts / admin. Still get up early - always want more sleep. Still value the few real friends I have left but still single - as never going though the hell of marriage again. Marriage = prison. Self esteem still low. Still selfish. Probably got a funeral plan - paying monthly! What a happy bunny!
