			 At 60 I would like to be retired from my current job, perhaps having a part-time job or some voluntary work. Hopefully I would be in good health and be able to spend time walking, taking holidays walking coastal paths etc with my husband and perhaps a dog. Some time would be spent on tending an allotment I would hope that both our children would be in successful careers and leading independent lives and in their accommodation.
