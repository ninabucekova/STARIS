			 I have down-sized to a smaller property to free up money to help my daughters buy property for themselves. I am living with several dogs and cats (all rescued). I am healthy & walking, cycling and excercising every day. I am still working part-time in a social job and entertaining friends in a relaxed manner. (I will be living with my husband if he is still alive, but if not, then I will be living alone. I will have boyfriends but not get married again). I enjoy cooking, gardening, reading, socializing.
