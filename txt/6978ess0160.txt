			 I AM STILL FAMILY ORIENTATED, KEPPING IN TOUCH WITH MY NIECES & NEPHEWS, & THEIR CHILDREN, THIS IS PROBABLY DUE TO THAT I DON'T SEE MY OWN SIBLINGS TOO OFTEN EXCEPT MY DAUGHTER WHEN I AM CLOSE TOO. I AM STILL WORKING HARD AS & CHEF, AND LOOKING TOWARDS RETIREMENT. I WILL STILL BE FOLLOWING MY FAVORITE FOOTBALL TEAM. LIVE WILL BE COMFORTABLE HEALTH HOPEFULLY WON'T BE TO BAD, AILMENTS UNDER CONTROLL.
