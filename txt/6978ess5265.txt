			 I am 60 years old. My life has changed dramatically from when I was 50 years old. To begin with, my parents-in-law are no longer with us - ((maybe) they are in a home and not needing the volume of care from me that I gave them ten years ago)). My husband, {HUSBAND}, is nearing retirement and we will be able to spend all our time together, just as we did twenty years ago. I am really looking forward to that. We are still totally devoted to each other and in love after thirty-two years of marriage. Generally, I am in good health - just the on going monitoring and defibrillator box changes for my heart (following a cardiac arrest in 1990). Few aches and pains, but at my age that is expected (they actually started when I was 50!). My memory is still no better than it was as long ago as thirty years ago (this caused by me suffering total amnesia when I had the cardiac arrest). The trips down to {LOCAL} Hospital are very infrequent now - not every three months as they were ten years ago. Most of my regular check-ups are now done via the telephone line! We are thinking of moving - within the village. We are sensible enough to know that the stairs and four bedrooms will become too much for us as we age further. We may buy an apartment - even closer to the shops, pubs and restaurants, then where we are now. Or, we move to a bungalow on this estate. Will just have to see what happens. I still go to the many things that I have belonged to in the village for many years. These include yoga - important for flexibility, Ladies Luncheon Club, Probus, WI and of course the dinner evenings that some girlfriends and myself take in turns cooking a meal. We have been doing this for many years.
