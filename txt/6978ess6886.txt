			 My husband and I no longer work. We spend time travelling. We spend a lot of time helping with the grandchildren and supporting our children. We enjoy life more as we have the time & money. I'm in good health. I help with a local charity, enjoy gardening, visiting National Trust properties, eating out, meeting up with friends and doing more to help our elderly parents. Life is good!
