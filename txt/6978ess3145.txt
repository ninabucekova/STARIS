			 hopefully I will have 'retired', but working 50-60 hours per week over the last 25 years have taken their toll, and health is poor. the dream of a quiet life is still almost unobtainable, the pressure of having 3 children of my own & 2 step-children & all the troubles & worries that brings means that there is NO time for 'us'. Retirement brings the chance for reflection, however. A Busy & challenging job does leave you with memories & experiences that mould what remains of your life. I work in a basic non challenging job, with little stress OR worry - part time & still allowing contact with the human Race. My personal relationship is good & strong but doubt & fears caused by the death of my first wife (2003) are still with me. overall I am happy but wish this happiness had come earlier in my wife.
