			 Retired from full-time employment in this country. Hopefuly my health will be even better than it is now, that is, that any effects of aging will bt counteracted by more sunshine, a healthier diet, more general exercise + certainly much less stress. I like to think I, & my husband will be involved in some business situation. Think my interest will be the same, reading seduku, DIY, socialising. Hope I will really have more time for other people. Work demands don't give me this currently. Looking forward to many more years, spending more time with my husband than I do now.
