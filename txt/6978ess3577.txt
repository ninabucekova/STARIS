			 I HAVE NOW RETIRED AND I AM CARRYING OUT VOLUNTARY WORK FOR THE LOCAL COMMUNITY 3/4 HRS PER DAY. I STIL ENJOY GOING TO WATCH OUR SON PLAYING FOOTBALL WITH MY WIFE, AND GIVE HIM FEEDBACK ON GAMES. MY WIFE {WIFE} IS DUE TO TAKE EARLY RETIREMENT SO WE CAN SPEND MORE TIME TOGETHER. WE STILL GO FOR WALKS EVERYDAY OUT IN THE COUNTRY/GOLF COURSE. WE STILL VISIT {DAUGHTER} OUR DAUGHTER ONCE A MONTH TO CATCH UP ON HER WORK NEWS. WE ARE BOTH IN GOOD SHAPE THANKS TO OUR VISITS TO THE GYM, WHICH STARTED 10 YEARS AGO. WE VISIT THE THEATRE & CINEMA REGULARLY.
