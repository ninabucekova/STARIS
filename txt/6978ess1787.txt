			 My husband & I have been retired for about 11 years now. Our children are grown & have left home & in relationships & in their own homes. We have downsized our family home & bought a smaller house in England & an apartment in Italy. We love visiting places for the scenery & sightseeing & taking our dogs for long country walks. Our grandchildren come & stay a lot in their holidays. We're very happy as a family.
