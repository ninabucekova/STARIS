			 At 60 (hopefully!) I will be in a smaller house with a bit more land. I will have chickens, ducks & goats. I will be mostly retired, working just one day a week. I will be reasonably healthy, with just a few aches & pains & still a vegetarian. I will have at least four grandchildren. I will have the time to travel more and I will visit Greece at least once a year. My husband will have got a smaller boat, but we will still go out on our boat a couple of times a week in the summer. I will feel happy & content, enjoying my life and watching my family grow.
