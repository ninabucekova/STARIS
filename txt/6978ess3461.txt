			 I find it hard to look forward ten year as at the moment I live on a very low income becaus I am disabled with chronic back pain. I do suffer from depression but can control that most of the time. I would hope that in ten years my pain may have eased and that would enable me to work to try and improve my life. I have no life at this time due to pain and lack of money. I would love to say, I will be living in a smaller house, be working part time and enjoying a good social life and possibly doing some voluntary work too.
