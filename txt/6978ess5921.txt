			 My husband is now retired and I have cut back on my work but do occasional work as an intermediary. I also run occasional courses which I can fit in around my home & social life. I am a new grandparent with new responsibilities visiting my family. I am in reasonable health and still enjoy dog walking and golf. I enjoy going out to the theatre, for dinner and socialising with friends. I continue to be involved in my local amateur theatre and my local church. I especially enjoy spending time abroad, and in this country, holidaying with my husband.
