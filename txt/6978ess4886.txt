			 At 60, I will be living on the West coast of Ireland in County {REGION} with my partner on a old stone cottage that we've renovated. I will be semi retired with a small parttime job that pays an income to cover essentials but does not have any responsibilities that involves bringing the job home with me every evening. I am healthy enough to enjoy my interests such as gardening, home furnishings, painting, drawing, reading and have a sense of calm in an environment of peace. My partner will be in full time employment and my mother/sister will be in a position to spend time with us on regular trips to our home from Manchester.
