			 Life hasn't changed a great deal. I'm still working in a similar job but in a different organisation. I need to work until 65 in order to pay the mortgage and get some sort of reasonable pension. My interests haven't changed. I'm taking a part-time course to keep my brain active outside work. My main exersise is walking. My wife and I are still in the same house, although we expect to downsize in order to reduce household bills and release cash ready for the expected reduction in income on retirement. Our two daughters have left home and are in decent jobs. Health is still reasonable, although still have trouble getting a good night's sleep.
