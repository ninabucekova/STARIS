			 I would hope to still have a place to live that has a garden and the place I live would not be too big for my needs. In an ideal world my home would be abroad in a warmer climate. I see no reason why I would not be as active and healthy as I am now but possibly finding some things a little harder purely because my body would be ageing. I would hope to be doing the same kind of work I am now but possibly less and be reasonably content with my lot having a partner to see me through my old age does not bother me I am happy to be single or not as the case might be. Ideally enough money to be comfortable would be perfect.
