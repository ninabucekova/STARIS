			 I expect I'll still be working when I'm 60, but it would be nice to work part-time, so I have more time for writing my novel. Perhaps I'd be cataloguing in a library, or halping to organise digital material if physical libraries are obsolete. But then again, I might be trying to finish a PhD in literature & have abandoned libraries to teach students & write articles, who knows? I expect I'd still be going to science fiction conventions to meet up with my Friends who would probably still be bemoaning the fact that not enough new young fans are sharing our interest in fanzines & old SF books. I hope I would still be living with [partner], though we might have moved away from [county] - We'd like to live in Europe, but that probably won't happen as [partner] doesn't speak any foreign languages - But maybe we'll be living in Scotland and doing some travelling - I'd like to think I'd still be fit and well, and able to go and explore Latin America or other parts of the world (if international travel is still feasible for ordinary people!)
