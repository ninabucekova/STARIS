			 Age is not something that worries me. I imaging at 60 I will be very active in my church. I hope to be working as a counsellor helping people. I hope to be healthy if not I will activate myself aroung my health. I'm an active person and believe you get out of life what you put in. I can activate or vegitate! You are as old as you feel. I think age is a state of mind.
