			 I am still working Part time, my husband has retired. My 3 children are in their late 30s now and my Grandchildren are growing up fast, eldest one is {SON1}, he's 20. I'm very close to them all, we have moved out of our 3 bedroom house into a nice little flat, we now go on holidays more seeing as its just the 2 of us. Even though our home is smaller, there is allways room for the children to stay.
