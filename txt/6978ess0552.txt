			 I am semi retired, my wife still works 2 days each week. In between travelling a lot I play golf whenever I can reasonably fit it in with our family committments and responsibilities. I work one or two days each week helping out at the local Citizens Advice Beauraux. My wife and I enjoy looking after our grandchild whilst my daughter is at work outside of day nursery hours and all day Mondays. We both keep fit walking in the Yorkshire Dales and Lake District as often as we can. Touch wood - we have no health problems worth worrying about.
