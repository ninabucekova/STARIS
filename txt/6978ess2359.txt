			 I would like to still have a base in {PLACE South East England} - possibly the same house that I am in now - but would ideally like to live predominantly in, say, {COUNTRY Europe}, where I have a 2nd house now. The weather here and the absurd level of immigration (which has changed my beloved homeland beyond recognition) cause me to imagine that as soon as my 4 precious children are thru' their education I will be off. I train every day and want to stay as fit as possibly in a warm, friendly and relatively UNCLEAR environment surrounded by Portugese people in their own country.
