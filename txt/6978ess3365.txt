			 I would hope that in ten years time I would still be working but in a position where I could comfortably retire to enjoy some leisure time. This would be with my wife and my seventeen year old son would be thinking about going to university. I would expect to be a grandfather as my two daughters would be 38 and 31 respectively. I would expect my health to still be good and that I would be reasonably active still. I would still be researching my family tree, which I began in the 1980's and would also be following cricket with some trips to follow England on tour. I would still be employed as an educational consultant either with a local authority of self employed. Life would be as good as it is now and I would be happy.
