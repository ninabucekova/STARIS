			 I HOPE TO BE IN A VERY MUCH LESS STRESSFUL JOB AND FOCUSED MORE ON "LOVE FOR THE JOB" OR ELSE WORKING FOR CHARITY/CHARITIES. HEALTH I HOPE IS STILL GOOD - BUT THIS MAY BE, TO AN EXTENT, BE OUT OF MY CONTROL (BITS EITHER WEAR OUT OR FALL OFF!) STILL VERY MUCH HAPPILY MARRIED AND MAYBE BY THEN A GRAND-DAD AND PARTICIPATING ACTIVELY WITH MY GRAND CHILDREN. DOING MORE ABOUT THE HOUSE WITH MY WIFE SUCH AS GARDENING, DIY AND HOBBIES (STAMPS, COMPUTER, THEATRE, WALKING ETC - THESE ARE A MIXTURE OF BOTH OF OUR HOBBIES). ENJOY LIFE TO THE FULL!! WHILE I STILL HAVE IT...
