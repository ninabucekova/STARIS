			 I am still working, as my pension investments have not been as successful as expected. My wife has stopped work and my daughter has finished university, so we're moving abroad to a kinder climate. We're looking at properties in Spain and southern Germany - as I travel for a living, I can live anywhere in Europe. My health is still fine, but I find all the travelling more stressful now and have a few health-related constraints to deal with. My wife hates being left at home, so she often travels with me, but this expensive, so I'm considering whether to retire or reduce the amount of work I do. I don't have much time for external interests yet but I have lots of plans for later on - UNCLEAR, snooker, cooking, gardening and cycling.
