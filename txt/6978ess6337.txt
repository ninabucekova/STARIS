			 I AM NOW RETIRED. BOTH MY WIFE AND I LIKE TO TRAVEL BOTH IN THIS COUNTRY AND ABROAD. I FEEL A LOT MORE ACHES AND PAINS BUT NOTHING THAT STOPS ME TOO MUCH. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF GRANDCHILDREN AND I LOVE SPENDING TIME WITH THEM. I HAVE A GARDEN THAT I AM PROUD OF AND SPEND A FAIR BIT OF TIME WORKING IN IT. I AM THINKING OF GETTING A PART TIME JOB TO BOTH HELP WITH INCOME AND MEET SOME PEOPLE. WE ARE CONSIDERING DOWN SIZING SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE TO RELEASE SOME CAPITAL BUT WE DO NOT WANT THIS TO PREVENT OUR FAMILIES COMING TO STAY.
