			 I am working as an Air Traffic Controller at {WORKPLACE Airport}, although retirement is just around the corner. I still ride motorcycles and now spend time rebuilding & restoring them. Golf is still a mjor part of my leisure time and so is my kayaking. My health remains good, although my joints sometimes play up - but not enough to curtail my activities! Life is good!
