			 I find this difficult as I have ME. Therefore I don't imagine much change to now. I probably wont be working. Hopefully I will be able to still potter around doing some housework and cooking, walking and swimming. I would like to go to more rugby matches, do some painting, play bridge and enjoy holidays. It would be nice to have grandchildren.
