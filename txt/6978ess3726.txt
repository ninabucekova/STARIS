			 I will be retired from the civil service but my wife will still be working, hopefully for a short while. I will have the chance to see some of my grandchildren. But this means travelling quite a lot. There are lots of things that need fixing and sorting out & I will have quite a lot to do. My 2 old motorcycles & rusty MG will still be in the garage, my eyesight & knee will mean that bending & being able to see is dim light will not make the work easy for me.

Only one of my children will be at University but they will all be healthy & fit 29/08/08
