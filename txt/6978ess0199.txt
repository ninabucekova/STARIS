			 I HAVE RETIRED FROM FULL TIME WORK, BUT HAVE TAKEN UP SOME DIFFERENT LINE OF WORK/INTEREST PROBABLY PART-TIME. MY FIRST WIFE (!) IS STILL WITH ME, LUCKILY. KIDS HAVE BOTH BEEN TO UNIVERSITY, BUT KEEP COMING BACK HOME. HEALTH IS STILL OK AND I'M ENJOYING THIS PHASE OF MY LIFE. MAKE SURE YOU LET ME SEE THIS WHEN I'M 60.
