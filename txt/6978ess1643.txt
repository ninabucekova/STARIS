			 I am retired and enjoying living in a rural area close to nature. Spending time with my grandchildren and family. Having very interesting and enlightening holidays around the world. Keeping mind and body healthy with physical exercise, dance classes and having lots of good friends. Perhaps doing some vuluntary work within the village and getting pleasure from helping others.
