			 This is difficult - as it is impossible to project with any accuracy what my life will be like in 10 years time. I would like to think that I will still be working in some capacity, to preserve my emotional well-being & financial health. My {SON} will have left home and I will sorely miss his company, and I hope that I will still have my friends around me - friendship means a lot. Financial security remains an issue - I have few savings so without work life will be very different - and this will impact upon my leisure pursuits - theatre, cinema, travelling. I exercise a lot & my health is good, but I of course expect deterioration of some kind - my back is already a problem rather like my mother, who suffers a great deal. Nonetheless, I am reasonably optimistic about the future and aways open to new opportunities with regards to work & lifestyle choices.
