			 I am feeling more at peace with myself and feel I have achieved what I wanted to achieve. Cleared our debts, go on holiday more and be able to relax and look after myself better. I think I will be in the same job but if there were any opportunities to progress within the fire Authority I would go for it. I plan to work up to 65 years, but would consider less hours if I thought best according to my lifestyle and circumstances.
