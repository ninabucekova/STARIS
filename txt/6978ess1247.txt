			 I would like to think I will still be very happily married, healthy and only working part-time. Perhaps have another dog, only this time from a puppy, going on a lot more holidays in our caravan, if the state of the nation has picked up again. Also I would like to imagine that we have finished all the works on our bungalow. But most of all I want my children to be settled & happy. It would be nice to have Grand-children.
