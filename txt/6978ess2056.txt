			 I hope I will be still in good health and looking forward to retirement. My husband will also be retiring shortly after me so I hope we will be able to travel and spend more time together after so many years of raising a family. We may have moved to the coast but my parents may need care so that could be a worry as I am an only child. I hope I will have some grand children and will be able to visit my children & grandchildren often. I would like to be involved in some environmental projects to preseve habitats and socialise with friends.
