			 I am working part time, planning for my retirement. I am looking forward to celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary. I still love walking daily with our dogs. We love spending time with our son and daughter (in law) and (hopefully) our Grandchildren. I fact life is as good as it was at '50'. spending time with other family members is also important, I am the eldest and have always had a good relationship with my brothers, sister and their families.
