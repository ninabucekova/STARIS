			 IM 60 YEARS OLD & PROBABLY STILL WORKING AS SUPERVISOR IN A STORE, IF MY KNEE'S HOLD OUT THAT IS. MY HEALTH IS NOT GOOD DUE THE SMOKING AND UNHEALTHY DIET & LACK OF EXERCISE. IM STILL LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH MY HUSBAND & TWO DOGS. HOPEFULLY I'LL STILL BE CARING FOR MY DAD (BUT I DON'T THINK SO) I HAVE A GOOD LOVING, FAMILY NETWORK. SO I CONSIDER MYSELF VERY LUCKY.
