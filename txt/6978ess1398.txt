				 National Child Development Study: Sweep 8, 2008-2009 
		 
			 I am working full time to make ends meet - paying for teenager & one child at university. I'm struggling with a dodgy hip and have my name down for a hip replacement. I live with my husband but not often amicably. I'm looking forward to retirement and the children being more independent. I see more of my friends and am now able to follow my personal interest now that the children are older, though I worry about them - whether they've taking drugs etc. or have good friends. We have little spare cash and holiday with relatives. We use public transport whenever possible and recycle / minimse electrical use and petrol too. It's too late to do anything about getting a decent pension so we plan to rent out a room to make ends meet. Entertainment is T.V. or D.V.D. I drink less (and less) alcohol and we never eat out as it's too expensive. We grow vegetables where our lawn used to be. Life is quiter though possibly more personally rewarding.
