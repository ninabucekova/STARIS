			 I'm living in a smaller house with a partner, the children and grandchildren are not too distant. I have a lovely garden, lots of books, cds and records. I'm busy selling records and cd's and doing Tarot readings for people and teaching them to meditate. Teaching people about the western esoteric Tradition. Few aches and twinges but nothing too bad. I'm still driving around Somerset in a morris Traveller and meeting up with friends and watching live music.
