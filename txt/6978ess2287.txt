			 I WON'T BE ABLE TO RETIRE, BECAUSE 'FRED THE SHRED' AND HIS PALS ARE SPENDING MY PENSION NOW AND THE NEXT GENERATION WORK FORCE ARE ALL TOO DEEPLY IN DEBT TO CONTRIBUTE. NEVER MIND, BEING IN THE I.T. INDUSTRY I SHOULD STILL BE ABLE TO WORK. IDEALLY FROM HOME, OR EVEN SELF-EMPLOYED AS SOME SORT OF CONSULTANT. I HOPE TO BE ACTIVE AS A MUSICIAN AND ARTIST (MY HOBBIES) ALSO GARDENING, ALL BEING WELL ON THE HEALTH FRONT. HOPEFULLY MY WIFE AND CHILDREN WILL NOT HAVE ABANDONED ME - I MAY EVEN BE A GRANDFATHER! IF WE ARE TALKING DAY DREAMS I WOULD LIKE TO VISUALISE MYSELF LIVING AND WORKING OR SOME SORT OF SUSTAINABLE, SEF-SUFFICIENT SMALL HOLDING OR COMMUNE - BUT HAVE NO REALISTIC PLANS TO ACHEIVE THIS AT PRESENT.
