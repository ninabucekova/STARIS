			 At 60 I would expect to be doing much the same as I do now. Enjoying my family life, wife and two boys and by then maybe some grandchildren. Making more effort to travel and experience the joys of seeing the world. My working life, where I run my own company and therefore have all the responsibilities that brings, along with the freedom of being flexible with my time. My home life, where I enjoy D.I.Y and keeping on top of the garden. My social life, where I occasionally play golf, walk regularly, enjoy going out to eat and being with family and friends. All of this subject to health, which at present allows me to do almost anything. Long may that continue!
