			 I am living with my wife of 23 years in the home, (which we now own outright) we have lived in for 20 years. I work at the local Railway Carriage works, (12 years so far), and am still able to ride my bicycle to and from work. I am an active (keen amateur) gardener and my well-established garden is a joy to behold. The fresh fruit and vegetables provide good diet and good wine! I feel lucky to be able to continue my long standing love of visiting places of interest like historic houses and gardens of the British Isles. Also spare time to volunteer at a local railway preservation society. My angina still sometimes gives me jip but I've had it for 22 years now so it doesn't stop me enjoying myself. Oh and I am now a devoted grandad! Be happy
