			 I have recently retired from work. I am looking forward to making good use of my increased leisure time. I will probably spend more time doing woodwork or DIY which I enjoy now if I have the time, but I would like to develop new skills such as learning another language or playing a musical instrument. I feel that my health will still be reasonably good and I will do more walking to keep fit. I will still be married. As our children will have just gone 20, I am looking forward to seeing them make their own way in life. We will now be able to have more flexibility as to when we can take our holidays and we may well be looking to move to somewhere quieter, probably to a smaller house. I may decide to work for a few hours either paid of voluntary, mainly for the social aspect.
