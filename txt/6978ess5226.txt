			 I expect that I will still be working in some way, but hopefully starting to reduce the number of days at work. I hope that I will still be in good health, allowing me to still travel abroad for holidays and walk long distance paths with my wife. I hope to purchase a classic sports car shortly, so I expect to still be able to get in & out of it without embarrasment & be able to afford its upkeep.
