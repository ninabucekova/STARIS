			 When I am sixty I hope to be consolidating my work/life balance and relationships. I will probably still live in London, though I often think of a more rural and less hectic lifestyle and environment. If my mother, who is nearly 80 still needs help, I may go to live nearer her. I am looking forward to the menopause being over and would like to be in a long term committed relationship with a man, but - I enjoy my freedom and independance so may be I will not!
