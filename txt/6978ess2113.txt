			 At 60 I expect to spend most of my time in France in a property we own, I do not expect to be working in my current industry, I will fund my living on the holiday industry in France, supplemented by some part time work. My wife will be with me and my family will be frequent visitors, we will also spend a fair number of weeks in the UK with our children & grandchildren. My health will still be good and I expect to spend more time in leisure activities such as golf, fishing motor cycling etc.
