			 I am 60 year old & I am working full time in Education or the Arts. I am still singing & involved with music making & can now play the piano enough for soirees & parlour evenings. My children have left home & my partner now lives with me. I am growing food in the garden as well as flowers. I can now swim properly & still go to the gym. I have started meditating on a daily basis & make a conscious effort to relax. I am happier. I am drawing & painting again. I have enough money to go on holiday & take my children & their families too. I am a grandmother!! I have learnt to drive & visit my mother regularly. I've stopped colouring my hair to the extent I do now. I am still in love with my partner. My health is good but I need to check for anxiety. I realise that I worry about the wrong things. I still show off & love compliments. I am learning new skills, maybe French. I still complain. I help my children with their lives. I am feel & believe that I am younger than I am. I worry that I am old.
