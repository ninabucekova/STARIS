			 I have remained married to my partner. I am still enjoying my four children at this stage of their lives. I am enjoying my grandchildren. I get a lot of satisfaction from my pets - a cat and a dog. I enjoy as much as always spending time in my mobile home in {PLACE East England}. I am as passionate as ever about playing my trumpet and have continued to improve and develop my ability. I have more time for water colour painting. My house is tidier and more organised. I am still working as many hours in a similar job, in a school. I still have spinal and joint problems but I still try my best to stay acceptably active. I enjoy a wide circle of friends and have more time to enjoy them.
