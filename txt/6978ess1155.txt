			 At 60 years old I will probably be working in education in some form or other. I may however choose to leave my job and become self employed as a singing teacher, this would be my ideal. I will still be persuing my interests of singing in local societies - health permitting. I hope to still be in good health and I hope to still be married to my husband. It is a possibility that we will move house to a detached property.
