			 My husband and I are still happily together. I am maintaining my scholiosis by going to Pilates classes and playing tennis (doubles!), although backache (and because of that, neck and headaches) are a constant problem - so, energy levels not great. Otherwise, I am healthy, positive and relaxed. I'm painting and drawing and have a part time job.
