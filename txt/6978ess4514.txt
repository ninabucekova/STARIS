			 I would hope my children are settled in happy relationships & fulfiling jobs. I hope my husband & I are still in good health & able to participate in our individual & shared interests - travel, theatre, art, "wining & dining", reading, gardening, walking. I hope to be working fewer hours - perhaps in a voluntary capacity. I hope to be financially secure and approaching retirement with enthusiasm.
