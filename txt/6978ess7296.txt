			 I am 60. I am in a long-term relationship but not married. I will be working part-time perhaps in holistic therapies. I will be travelling on holiday 2-3 times per year. I may be a grandmother but would not care for my grandchild(ren) full time, but maybe one day a week and some holidays. I have some good friends who I support and who support me. I will spend most of my leisure time with my partner & will do some sort of exercise, such as hill-walking, to keep fit. I will continue to eat healthily and maintain my interest in ll forms of chocolate. I fear mental and physical deterioration and that of my partner. I have no faith in being well cared for by the NHS.
