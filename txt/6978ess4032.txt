			 Now that I am 60 years old and my husband is not working on the farm as much we have more time together. We live on our own near the farm so that we can keep in touch with what is going on and also help out when necessary. I enjoy travelling and walking. I am involved in the local life and church still. Hopefully I am still fit and healthy.
