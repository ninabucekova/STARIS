			 60 yrs of age now, & we have been married for 32 yrs now. We have left {PLACE1 West Midlands England} & have bought a bungalow in the Peak District - a place we have both loved to visit for many years. I love pottering around in the garden. Keeping active is important & we both love going on long walks around the countryside that we know well. I still enjoy watching the motorcycling & still make the trip to watch the British Grand Prix. Having given up my security job a few years previous, my back trouble has eased a lot - not on my feet for long hours. Health is still pretty good, although some of the hills we go up, have to be done a bit slower. Still visit relatives in {PLACE1} & {HUSBAND}'s sister comes down to visit. I have been lucky to find a partner & friend that is loving & kind to spend the rest of my life with.
