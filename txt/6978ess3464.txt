			 When I am 60 I think I will still be working and hope that it will be similar to the job I have currently. I would like to get involved in some sort of voluntary work and also join a choir as by then my children will be adults and less in need of me. I need to get more active to help maintain my health which is generally good. I hope to be able to move to the Countryside and be able to have more holidays with my partner.
