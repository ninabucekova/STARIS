			 I feel I will still be in the same job but that my creative hobbies will become more important as I have more time to do them. If I'm lucky I will still have my parents but theyre 88 and 84 now!! My children will be settled The oldest out of uni & settled in work and also the youngest at work - so more time for me. I hope that my husband and I can spend more time doing things together. Also be able to spend more time gardening. Will keep up dancing / badminton. Probably always have bit of a bad back now and again but don't think it will stop me doing things I want to.
