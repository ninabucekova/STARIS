			 I can now enjoy freedom from an unfulfilling job And have enough money to enjoy my hobbies and take time to "smell the roses". I've had to give up some more strenuous activities but hopefully replaced them with some others. I imagine I'll always be shackled with my "black dog". Any work I do will definately be something I enjoy, So "two fingers" up to those autocratic egostistical managers that have blighted my working years ... Hope thats not to controversial?
