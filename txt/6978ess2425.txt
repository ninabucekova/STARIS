			 My day revolves around my dog, we go out very early for long walks over the fields, climbing over styles, I walk briskly and we usually take approx an hour. I arrive home and have breakfast, before contacting friends to either go swimming or go for lunch, do a spot of shopping, proper tea for husband and family if they are due to visit, I sometimes visit my mother-in-law and help with her housework. Once or twice a week. On a Friday evening my husband and I will pop out to a restaurant then onto the local pub to meet up with friends and catch up on events UNCLEAR the recent week/s. During the week I pop into our local charity store to work for a few hours to give voluntary help. Every couple of months we will go to our house in {COUNTRY Europe}, which we hope to retire to when my husband eventually retires.
