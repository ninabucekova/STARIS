			 Having had breast cancer I feel very lucky to be here at all - every day is a bonus and at 60 I hope to be living my life as fully as I am able. I'm hopefully still working in the wine trade - which I love - & my Mortgage will be paid off leaving me a lot better off & able to afford to go off for weekends, to the places I would still love to visit, & to generally do things I couldn't really afford before. I'll be eating out with my friends on a regular basis - going to the the cinema, the theatre & generally enjoying life! I may be physically more restricted in what I can actually do but I'll give everything a good try!
