			 I IMAGINE THAT I WILL NOT BE LIVING HERE AND THAT I WILL BE DOING SOMETHING THAT IS MORE FULFILLING AS THE CHILDREN WILL NOT BE A FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ANY MORE. THEREFORE I WILL NOT BE UNDER SO MUCH PRESSURE TO EARN. I DO NOT KNOW HOW FIT I WILL BE AND THIS WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING WHAT I WILL BE DOING.
