			 Having made it to 60, I hopefully will be able to say that since 50 when my youngest son turned 17 and was effectivelly "off my hands" the ability to travel more extensively presented itself. My interest in travel has always been a keen one which without the encoumbrance of young children has meant I could follow with more vigour. Having paid of my mortgage a few year ago, I have had more freedom to travel. I still work full time, but I am considering cutting down to 4 days per week. Accountancy only holds so much interest! I still have a large circle of friends with whom I keep in regular contact, and a varied Social life.
