			 I will have retired from my job after at least 35 years service with the same employer & will be comfortable with a good pension & having paid my mortgage off. I will have a part time job, or just finished this & will be doing some charity work, or committee work at my Golf Club. Both of my children will have completed University & holding down a responsible job & may be married with children. I would have been married for nearly 35 years & happy at home. Hopefully I will continue to be fit & healthy & able to play golf at least 2/3 times a week. I will still be living in the area that I am currently living & most probably in the same house.
