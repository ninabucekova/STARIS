			 I have now been retired for 3 years and feeling fitter and better than I did for the last 3 years that I was working. All the time in the world to go walking and swimming, and I get more time for reading and possibly doing a higher degree. Home life settled and happy, plenty of breaks with my wife - Looking forward to happy & productive adult children and grand children.
