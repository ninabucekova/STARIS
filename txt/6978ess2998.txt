			 My children are happy in their jobs and personal lives. I am in regular contact with all three. I don't think any will be married or have presented me with grandchildren. Jobwise I think I will still be doing some form of teaching, but whatever the job is, it will be part-time. I'll have downsized but still living in {PLACE South East England}. I would love to think I've been in a relationship for several years but would at least like feel fulfilled & to have a good social life. My expectations is that I'll feel happier that at any other stage in my life and that I'll also be slim and healthy.
