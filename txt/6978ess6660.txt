			 I expect my life will be much the same. Probably still doing the job I am doing at present, I would like to work less if possible more time for leisure interests. I would like to have maybe learn't some new skills eg. learn't to drive or taken up some new interests. My health I hope won't have changed much except for more general aches and pains which come with age. My home life would be settled as it is at present.
