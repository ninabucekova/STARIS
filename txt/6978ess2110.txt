			 Hopefully I will be retired before I reach 60 years of age if now I will definately be semi-retired. With a bit of luck, I will still be fit enough to walk two hours a day "as I do now". I will probably be working 3 days a week spending the rest of the time relaxing walking & reading. Possibly doing some sort of charity work one or two days a week.
