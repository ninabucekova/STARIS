			 At 60 I hope to be involved in academic music and to have completed some books on my subject - I would hope to have much time for home life to be with my wife and children - and to be helping them in their early teens and supporting their studies and social life. I would hope to be in good health and to be fit. to be engaged in some lighter sports activity like walking, swimming etc and to be regularly in touch with my counterparts and friends.
