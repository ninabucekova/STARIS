			 I am now 60 years old. I cannot work due to problems with my back. Problems that I have had to endure for over 10 years. My life is held in the balance of how much pain I am in from one day to the next as to where and how far I am able to travel (walking). I see no hope of getting better as the Quality of NHS is only getting worse due to the lack of funding.
