			 In ten years both my children will have left home and I suppose I will be thinking about retirement! I visualise a life partially here in {PLACE1 Scotland} and partially abroad.. perhaps travelling or perhaps living in a house that we have bought. My health will hopefully continue to be good to allow me to do this. I will of course still be with my husband - we have planned lots of adventures together. We might even be grandparents by then! I will still sing, enjoy music, good food & good wine!
