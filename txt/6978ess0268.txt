			 I would like to think I will be working part time dividing my time between paid work & voluntary work. I would ideally like to have taken up some interesting hobbies - painting in acrylics & water colours, birdwatching, diving, going to the gym, swimming. I hope to be living in the countryside near to a small town. I would like to be supporting my grown up children & my grandchildren by baby sitting & helping them out with money for holidays. I would like to be able to walk in the countryside.
