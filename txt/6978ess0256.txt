			 My physical health is excellent, regular gym, pilates & yoga sessions (several per week) have led to this. I am financially secure and able to help various friends & charities as a result. I remain interested in Financial Trading, and horse racing. Having succeeded in physical & financial areas, more focus now on spiritual practices & developments as I age. My loose network of friends continue to provide adequate social contact.
