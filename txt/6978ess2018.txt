			 Life at 60 is pretty similar to life at 50. I have maintained good heatlh, my partnership with my lover is even deeper & more profound (hopefully she will no longer be troubled by the menopause!). I have continued to be creative -writing poetry and making collage and other art. Our pensions are adequate for the life styles we have chosen. I remain a surrealist and a marxist, committed to human emancipation, as I was in the days of my youth. Art galleries, cinema, reading, walking, a rich and fulfilling sex life are how the days are spent - Life is good!!
