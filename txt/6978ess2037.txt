			 My life evolves around my family who are the most important thing in my life. I love to join my friends in at least two taichi classes per week, more if possible. I follow a healthy diet and therefore my health is very good and therefore I am able to take part in any activity I wish. My vitality for life is excellent - this is enhanced by tai chi and the life style it encourages. I have retired and have taken up gardening growing my own vegetables etc. I work as a volunteer at my local church.
