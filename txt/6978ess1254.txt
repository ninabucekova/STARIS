			 I am enjoying golfing with my friends , working in the garden and the family visiting. Not looking forward to having my other hip replaced but suppose it will be worth it. Working part-time enjoying a good, active social life. Going to the Health Centre and eating well. Glad that my pace of life is not as hectic but still interesting.
