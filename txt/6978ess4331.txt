			 I am still working at the same job Nursing Assistant but less hours. I am still in good health and manage to get out and about and enjoy myself. My family are grown up so its me and my husband we get on well together although have our arguments like others do. We care a lot for our grandchildren, and still have our pets to keep us going. We socialise about once a fortnight or when we possibly can, depending on work commitments. We love our holidays in the hot sunshine. on the whole we have a good life and a happy one.
