			 I would imagine still living in my house with my husband. Perhaps not still working at my present Job. Possibly looking after grandchildren, which I would love to do. I would imagine my health to be on a par to how I feel now. Perhaps a little slimmer and possibly more grey hair. I would hope to still be able to enjoy walking holidays on the Lake District, and still be driving and enjoying the same social events. Hopefully some, if not all of our children would have moved into their own homes, be with a partner and there be grand children. I would hope my husband is in good health and be in a part time job. Possible, we would own a caravan in Wales, and continue walking my Dog.
