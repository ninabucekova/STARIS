			 Hopefully my arthritis won't be anymore restrictive than it is already so that I will continue to care for my family, help look after my grandchildren and enjoy everyday activities with them like walking in the park, swimming etc. I will be looking to retire after working as a nurse for 40+ years with a pension that will allow me to continue to live comfortably not extravagantly but comfortably so my husband and I can enjoy life as we do now going abroad at least yearly and visiting the theatre and eating out when we want to.
