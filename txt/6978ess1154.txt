			 My current interests are walking, feeling happy & going on holidays I hope to continue these. I hope my husband & my daughters are happy. I hope & I am sure that I wouldn't be working, as I have been working since I was 16 years old. I hope perhaps to have a little dog & maybe have Grandchildren (although it wouldn't matter). If my daughter is happy then I am. Also to have hobbies UNCLEAR perhaps dancing. To afford the roof above my head.
