			 I have just returned home from my round the world trip - my sole amibition in life was to be a 'grown up back-packer', having missed that opportunity as a teenager. I am now settling back into work. My health is good and to improve it I have joined the local health club; I am able to do this now as there is more money available now that my daughter has left home and the mortgage is repaid. For a few hours a week I am able to do volunteer work, something I have not done since my twenties - this gives me the feeling I am contributing. I feel much happier now there is less money worries and more to spend on myself. Generally life is good!
