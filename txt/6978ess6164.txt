			 I find this difficult as life can change drastically as a result of 1 or 2 events which are impossible to predict. However in general I think I will be living in the same locality as I live now. I will be working full time but maybe considering working part-time. My children are likely to be living away from home but will remain in touch My husband may be retired or considering retiring. I envisage being in a variety of activities including walking/ seeing friends/ going to the theatre and going on holidays I also will be involved in church activities and attend church on a regular basis
