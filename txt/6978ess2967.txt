			 Age 50 Currently Im a self employed science & engineering consultant with penty of freedom to choose to work or not and engage in leasure activities Age 60 I would expect to do occasional science & engineering consultancy out of interest & spend more time on research projects of interest to me. By then I hope to be writing articles regularly for pleasure - non-fiction & fiction, perhaps earning something from it at sometime. Hopefully my health will allow me to continue cycling, hiking, running & beating the locals at Badminton. If time allow & my fingers still work, my piano may get more use. I will always have a great love of nature, the environment and science, even of the news is not good in 2018. My health will probably have declined in that my knees, ankles hips, back etc will crumble a bit more interfering with sports & hiking etc but I will try to overcome even if severe. Like everybody else I dont want any serious illnesses and will do what ever I can to reduce the risks, but I do worry a bit about my health in the future & hope not to get anything major. I will still have ambition, but will hope to have more leasure time. Expect to be with same partner but no kids, 'nature' and time/age will have ended these chances. PERSONAL
