			 I RETIRED 5 YEARS AGO. I'VE SUPPLEMENTED MY PENSION WITH A BIT OF CONSULTING WORK - MOSTLY ON THING'S THAT PARTICULARLY INTEREST ME. I'VE BEEN TRYING TO REACQUIRE SOME OLD CORE SCIENCE SKILLS AND DO THE PhD. I ELECTED NOT TO DO ALMOST 40 YEARS AGO. WE TRY AND DO OUR BIT TO STAVE OFF THE "COLLAPSE OF CIVILISATION AS WE KNOW IT" DUE TO WORSENING EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE - LESS TRAVEL, LOCAL FOOD SUPPORT ETC. I TRY AND KEEP FIT AND ACTIVE, BUT THE OLD INJURY THAT WENT ARTHRITIC CONTINUES TO PLAGUE ME, BUT STAVED OFF THE HEART ATTACK THAT GOT MY PARTNER, SO FAR... MANAGED TO SAVE MY LAST MUNRO ASCENT FOR MY 60TH BIRTHDAY - GOOD PARTY AFTERWARDS WITH ALL THE OLD COLLEGE CLIMBING CROWD! FINALLY MANAGED TO CATCH THE ROLLING STONES LIVE IN CONCERT...
