			 My husband & I are still living happily together & are in good health. We've moved to a smaller house ready to retire & closer to family in the South. I'm working part time running my own consultancy business. I've taken up playing golf so I too can enjoy the golf courses & activity not only at home but on holidays. George has achieved his dream to have a career related to perfoming in sport - may be even being at University in the USA. My sister & her family are happy & settled. Not sure that mum & dad will still be with us.
