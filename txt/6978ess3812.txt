			 I IMAGINE I'M RETIRED, BUT KEEPING MY HAND IN BY DOING SOME CONSULTING WORK IN MY INDUSTRY FOR SOME MONEY, TRAVEL & INTEREST. I'M LIVING AS A MARRIED PERSON TO MY CURRENT PARTNER IN THE {COUNTRY1 Europe} OR / AND THE 'MED' WITH OCCASIONAL VISITS TO THE UK TO SEE MY CHILDREN, (IF THEY'RE STILL LIVING HERE), FAMILY AND FRIENDS. I TRAVEL ALOT WITH MY PARTNER TO VISIT NEW PLACES (AND SOME OLD ONES). GO SKIING A LOT AND HAVE SEVERAL DIVERSE HOBBIES. I KEEP AS FIT AS POSSIBLE AND EAT WELL, DO NOT DRINK AND HAVE HOPEFULLY GIVEN UP SMOKING. I HAVE RETIRED WITH ENOUGH MONEY NOT TO WANT FOR ANYTHING AND DOING WHAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED... LIVING IN PEACE WITH A BEAUTIFUL AND LOVING PARTNER (AND MAYBE OUR OWN CHILDREN!)
