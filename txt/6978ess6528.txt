			 I imagine that my husband will be retired and perhaps doing some voluntary work. If not already done so, my son will be leaving home and/or we will be helping him set up in a flat. I will be working still as my husband has virtually no pension. I enjoy my garden and running and hope that these activities will help me stay healthy. I hope that we will have sufficient income to have holidays abroad - there are still some countires I'd like to visit.
