			 I would like to think that I will be in a position to travel more as this is of great interest to me. If I am not in paid employment I would like to do some type of voluntary work to help disadvantaged young people. I have a love of animals and would hope to be able to have the time to keep one or two dogs. Hopefully I will still be able to take part in activities such as swimming walking and badminton. Most importantly of all I wish to still be in good health to enjoy my family.
