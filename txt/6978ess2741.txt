			 I imagine that I would not be working now, my daughter would be 31 and hopefully working as a doctor & married. My son would be 27 with a good job and his own house and possibly married. My youngest would be 23 and maybe still at university or have a good job. It could be that my husband & I are now living at home with all the children living away. He may well be retired and I would like for us to have several holidays/breaks throughout the year, visiting many places. I would hope that I would be more conscious of my health (diet, exercise etc) and have enough money to live comfortably. I am sure that I would still be very close to my sister and brothers and their children too, and health permitting I would be leading a full, varied and active life.
