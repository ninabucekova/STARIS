			 I will be working still, probably teaching, but in my last year and looking forward to retirement. I will follow my interests of walking, esp. hill walking in the Lake District and other places. I will be looking forward to visits from my three older children who will be 29, 28 and 26. My youngest child will be 21 and possibly still at university. I will enjoy my dogs, possibly having 2 or three, taking them 'picking up' on a local shoot on Saturdays. I will work my smallholding and grow vegetables. I will hopefully be healthy and keep fit with walking, cycling and manual labour.
