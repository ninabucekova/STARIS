			 I stopped working a few years ago when my husband retired and now just do a few days supply teaching to keep in contact with old friends. I spend most of my time working towards self sufficiency in the kitchen and garden. I have enlarged my flock of chickens since I retired and neighbours are happy to buy my surplus eggs. My vegetable and fruit plots have expanded too and I have started experimenting with freezing/pickling/preserving excess produce to use later in the year. I find that gardening is relaxing and good exercise and more importantly gets me out in the fresh air. The only conflict in my life is that my husband wants to spend months away travelling and I don't like to leave my family and garden for that long!
