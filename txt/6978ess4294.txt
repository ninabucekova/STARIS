			 I am living in the same neighbourhood, I may have moved to a larger house. This house provides guest bedrooms, dining room, music room or library and one or two acres of land. Our children visit regularly, they have 'good' jobs & happy relationships. They may stay over in our 'guest bedrooms'. I collect eggs from the chickens in our garden, I collect fruit veg & herbs from our garden also. I continue to work and still cannot imagine ever retiring. I teach very little now, but continue to run our family business with my husband. The work continues to be challenging and fulfilling. There are healthy financial rewards. I do not ever worry about financial security. We can support our children and their families if necessary. I travel regularly, I am remember, free from the work load burden of teaching. I may have a property in france. Towards the south where the summers are warm. Here I would relax, read paint chat with friends & family. The world I live in is dark, I am watched by cameras as I move around the neighbourhood. I am not allowed to drive a car of my choice, it is difficult for most People to survive financially. Bills are high and govt penalties are many. Luckily I live my life in this world with my husband by my side.
