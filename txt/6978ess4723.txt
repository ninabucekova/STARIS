			 I have worked very hard all of my working life and never been out of work. I have constantly worried about money and being able to provide a secure and good standard of living, this is despite everyone around me being backed up by Government handouts! Now I'm 60 and I wanted to retire at 60, but I can't and I have to go to 65 because of the mismanagement of the economy by successive Governments. Just to placate the voter.
