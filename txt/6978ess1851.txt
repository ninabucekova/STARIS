			 Worse Case! I visit the family via a 'medium' & tell them there is life after death! Good Message, a bit of a bummer that I've gone early!! Serious (Dream) I am sitting on my boat in Tasmania, Australia Watching the dolphins & a beautiful sunset. I'm making plans with My husband & some friends for a boat trip around the Coast. My daughter has moved to Australia and is a part-time lecturer and part owner of a 'Surf' school holiday complex. I have two beautiful grandchildren in Australia. I do not need to do paid work now (some dream eh!!) but I do some Voluntary Work with children & old people.

I feel relaxed & happy and look forward to the future.
