			 At 60 years old, I would imagine I'd be doing similar things to the present. My son will be 18 and hopefully a happy adult emparking on his life. I would expect to be close to him and we share common interests. My profession could change but I will adapt to any major overhaul. My health will probably suffer as a result of the increasing age and my finances will probably drop. I hope to be happy and content at 60 years of age.
