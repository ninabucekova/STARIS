			 Semi-retired, still teaching a few hours per week, perhaps to cover absent staff. Taking long holidays, 3-4 weeks in colder months. Spending time with grand children. Love to walk - set off with the dog, stop for a pub lunch. All things done with my husband who is fully retired. Have regular dinner parties. Eyesight and hearing not A1 - but apart from that, quite healthy. More wrinkles than I would like!
