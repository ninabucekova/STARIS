			 My husband & I are still Healthy & enjoying weekend away in our Caravan. I possibly might have given up work to help care for my Grandchildren while my children are at work as the cost of living doesn't able them to not work. For relaxing I hope I can still go dancing & walking to help my fitness But most of all my family gives me the greatest joy, long may it continue.
