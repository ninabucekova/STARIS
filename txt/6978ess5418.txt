			 At 60 years old I hope to be retired from work and spending a lot more time with my family. Going for walking holidays in the countryside with my husband. I hope I will have good health although I have painful hips at present so we'll see. I feel I will have to do some kind of voluntary work to fill in some of my spare time and give something back to the community, it would have to be working with people who for some reason require assistance. I really enjoy helping people.
