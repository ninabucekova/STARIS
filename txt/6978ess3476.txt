			 I'm hoping to be looking after + helping my grandson (aged 2 now) and other grandchildren. I will probably be still working as I won't have enough money to retire on!! I hope to be reading a lot and also to have time to go out and socialise e.g in pubs, restaurants, cinema and theatre. I also hope to have enough money to enjoy holidays at home or abroad. Having good nutritous food is important to me, and I will be going to the gym + for walks etc. I also hope to have met a new partner as I am a widow + I do not wish to be spending my later years on my own. All my 3 children will have left home by then so I do not wish to living on my own.
