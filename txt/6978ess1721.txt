			 I have now retired from full time work but do some occassional bank shifts for extra money. My youngest son has left home now and my husband and I have time for holidays now. I spend a lot of time with my grandchildren now aged 13, 11 and 11. I try to keep fit by walking running and gym. I enjoy knitting, sewing and reading and I am now enjoying carft classes that I didn't have time for 10 years ago. Still battling to keep the weight off but more successful now with time to exercise. Tired but happy with my life.
