			 I am fully settled in my life, I have male friends but never remarried - I enjoy the company of men but find myself too set in my ways to share my space with a man full time. My lovely {DAUGHTER1} remains settled with round the clock care and I pick her up once a week and we walk and I feed and cuddle her and tell her how much I love her and the guilt stays. My second and middle daughter {DAUGHTER2} still has her mood swings and calls her dad all the names under the sun when really she just wants his arms around her. She doesn't seem to flinch at my touch any more, and I do what I can to help with her children - but its never enough again guilt remains and my {DAUGHTER3} - the daughter I had at 38 born into a loveless marriage, but so meant to be, at 22 I worry about the boys at the door! I like being 60 Im free, healthy and happy - And despite everything, Im blessed!!
