			 We now have more time to enjoy life having completed work on the house. My father has recently died & I have inherited his house. I will sell this & probably buy a small cottage to let out. Because money is easier {HUSBAND} (my husband) is more relaxed & better company. I now have much more time for painting sculpting & photography & so feel more contented and stimulated again. Our rescued dogs are older & better behaved making life easier all around. My health is a bit wobbly as usual but my chiropractor puts me back together well! I still try to help out with local greyhound rescue charities.
