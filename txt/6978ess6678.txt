			 I am still a teacher although I now only work 3 days a week and spend the other two on my hobbies. My wife is close to retirement and my children have completed their education. I have some grandchildren and like to look after them occasionaly! My hobbies are painting and hill walking so they can be done together which improves my health and mental well-being. I am looking forward to my retirement in a few years time.
