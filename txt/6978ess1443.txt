			 I feel health will not be as good because my work is quite physical and is late at night so I don't get enough sleep. I expect my marriage to be still strong. Both my sons to be married and have fully left home I don't have a lot of interests except perhaps walking and watching films. I still expect to be working but hopefully not full time. I also would like to be in a different location from where I am now.
