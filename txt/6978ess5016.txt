			 I AM NOW SEMI-RETIRED WORKING ONLY 2 DAYS A WEEK. I ENJOY SPENDING TIME WITH MY GRAND-CHILDREN, AND SPEND MY LEISURE TIME GARDENING, WALKING AND ATTENDING SPORTING EVENTS. MY WIFE AND I ALSO ENJOY TRAVELLING AS OFTEN AS FINANCES WILL ALLOW. MY MAIN CONCERNS AND WORRIES ARE CENTRED AROUND HEALTH-CARE FOR MY OWN AND MY WIFE'S ELDERLY PARENTS.
