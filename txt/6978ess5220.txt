			 I am busy caring for my family. I spend a lot of time at home. I like to visit family & friends. I watch quite a lot of television & listen to music. Go for drives in the car, into the country or the seaside. Read a newspaper every day. Look after the cats. Go shopping & do cooking everyday. Most of my time is taken up by being a carer of my partner.
