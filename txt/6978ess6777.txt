				 National Child Development Study: Sweep 8, 2008-2009 
		 
			 I am married, living in the country or on the coast with my husband. All the children have left home; some are married with children of their own. We stay in close contact with them & see them often. We have dogs & they keep us active. I am more active & healthy, & take more exercise that at 50. I am no longer in paid employment but actively involved in church & voluntary projects. My health is good; we grow our own vegetables. My husband works part-time & we are able to do things together. We like to visit National Trust/English Heritage places by we use the car as little as possible. I may do a history course & our holiday this year will be riding a Harley Davidson around America.
