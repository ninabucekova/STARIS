			 I have a stressful job in sales and hope as I get older I may become more relaxed. I would love a career change to get away from the pressures of sales. I do enjoy my job but changes at work especially in attitudes of management are making me look for alternative employment. I regard myself as healthy and reasonably fit for my age. My home life can become stressful from time to time but we grin and bear it.
