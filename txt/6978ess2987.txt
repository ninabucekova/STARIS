			 I am retired but busy with outside interests, such as exploring the area by walking and cycling, doing some creative writing, learning something new such as a musical instrument or IT skills, and doing some part-time work for additional money and social contact. I am still married and enjoying the extra time with my wife, and we regularly travel abroad. Our children are in good jobs and seem to have settled relationships. Apart from minor health issues, I am still in good health and trying to keep fit.
