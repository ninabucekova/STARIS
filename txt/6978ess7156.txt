			 I am married to a lovely man, who enjoys the simple things in life like me. We enjoy gardening, walking the dogs & going round old houses. We both work full time & enjoy our time off. I am in relative good heatlh for my age. I enjoy my garden & planting new plants each year. I sometimes get sad when I think back about my dad & my loss of him.
