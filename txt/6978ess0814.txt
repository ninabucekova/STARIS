			 At 60 I still expect to be working (teaching) (although not for many years more!) The thought of retirement will be double-edged. Less work related stress, more time to be with my wife, doing bits and pieces around the house and enjoying leisure pusuits but probably feeling less fit and healthy to enjoy them and of course the closer you get to retirement the closer you are getting to old age and death! I expect both of our daughters will have left home but I would hope that we would still be seeing them on a regular basis. I hope we will continue to enjoy a reasonable standard of living. Over the past 5 years or so we have not had to worry particularly about money, there always being sufficient income to cover outgoings, emergencies etc. and I would hope/expect this to continue. We may have got rid of the two cars my wife and I have to run for work reasons and have opted for sporty, fun vehicle (but one which is high enough off the ground so that we can get into it with aching backs and dodgy knees!). On retirement I would hope to be able to spend more time on some leisure pursuits I have: bowling with my wife and watersports (kayaking & windsurfing) On retirement I cannot imagine myself doing any regular other work.
