			 I enjoy knitting, reading, & having the family round - my health is deteriating but I live for a day at a time and I try to keep focused on the job at hand. I enjoy most things including going to the local pub to support the ladies darts team, I try not to let anything bother me but I have a couple of close freiends who sort me out iff I don't know how to cope. I don't go to work as my health stops me.
