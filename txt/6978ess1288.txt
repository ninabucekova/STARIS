			 I hope by 60 I will have established a training/consultancy business and that I will be working less hours for more money. This would give me time to do the things I want to do such as writing, gardening and traveling. I would hope to have a more spacious house with a larger garden. I would like to have space for my grandchildren and friends to stay. I would like to be enjoying a happy and loving life with my husband. I would see us both having a bit more time to do things that we enjoy. I hope my health will have imporoved due to stopping smoking - and drinking less - this will come as a result of less stress in my life. I hope I will have more time to enjoy walking or fitness class. I will not drive as much, work as much and will be off HRT! I would like to see myself as a calmer person at 60 but who knows what life will bring? My (6) grandchildren will be teenagers then and I would like to be able to support them emotionally and a little financialy if possible. I have one son who has Aspergers Syndrome and I hope to be around to continue supporting him in his life as well as having good times with him, holidays & outings. I imagine myself then as a mature, professional business woman, in a supportive and loving partnership with my husband. We take good care of ourselves and our children (7 between us) and our grandchildren. As we work in social work caring for other will always be part of our lives. This will have been a long journey from the proverty of my early life.
