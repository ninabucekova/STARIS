			 I am still working, hopefully on reduced hours. I have a few more grand children (some probably living abroad) who are a vital part of my life and whom I visit as often as I can. I am still married but maybe living in a small house with a smaller garden to allow for more leisure time and less physical work. I am still riding my motorbike - but less in the winter. I am still going abroad on my motorbike and around the country to watch motor racing. I am fit and healthy and spend alot of time on the fells in the Lakes and Dales areas.
