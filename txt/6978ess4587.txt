			 I am working part-time doing voluntary work, and also doing some creative writing. My interests include cycling, skiing, gardening and botany. I am still living in the same house as now. My health is fine. The nest is now empty but the children live in {PLACE South West England} and we still see them a lot. We have grandchildren too. And a dog. My wife and I spend time together, but also pursue our own things separately.
