			 I would like to think that I am retired and living in {PLACE}, {REGION South West England}. Both my children are happily married. My husband and I spend the summer cycling to the beach with a picnic and spend the day on the beach reading. The rest of the year we would spend walking and enjoying the lovely Purbecks. During the winter months we may have to work p/t. Hopefully cycling daily and lots of walking would keep us both in good health.
