			 I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT I WILL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO MY RETIREMENT, WITH OR WITHOUT A PARTNER. I HOPE I WILL BE IN REASONABLY GOOD HEALTH. I WOULD LIKE TO BE GETTING SOME KIND OF REGULAR EXERCISE AND TO BE SPENDING SOME OF MY TIME WITH MY GRANDCHILDREN. I HOPE TO BE SEEING MORE OF MY SISTERS THAN I AM CURRENTLY ABLE TO. I HOPE TO BE A LONG WAY AWAY FROM MY CURRENT BOSS, PREFERABLY HAVING TOLD THE NASTY, PEDANTIC, INSUFFERABLE WOMAN TO SHOVE HER JOB WHERE THE SUN RARELY SHINES! IF I AM STILL WORKING I'D LIKE IT TO BE FOR SOMEONE WHO APPRECIATES MY CONSCIENTIOUS HARD-WORKING NATURE AND PAYS ME WHAT I'M WORTH - SOME HOPE!
