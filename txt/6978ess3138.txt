			 Hopefully I have retired or Semi-retired. If I have fully retired I would enjoy doing voluntary work. My children have moved away and settled happily in their own lives and are enjoying their own families. I am enjoying my life with my husband doing the things we may have missed doing while the children were young. My health is good and I enjoy working part-time to keep in touch with the world outside my family life. I love visiting my children and grand children. I love going shopping (maybe only window shopping) reading, watching T.V. and going for walks with my husband. I have a happy comfortable life, in my own house.
