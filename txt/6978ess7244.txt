			 I am now taking things a bit easier, have semi-retired. I am working part-time & help look after my grandchildren. My husband & I enjoy caravaning & love to go off for weekends. My job is at a restaurant & I help out part time in the kitchen. Have learnt a lot from the chef & love to spend time cooking at home.
