			 Difficult Question!! I would not expect a great many changes in my life regarding home life and interests. My home life is settled and happy and routine and interests revolve around my Bible Based beliefs. It is my way of life. I share Bible truths regularly with others in my neighbourhood both in the English areas and in Multi Language areas, ie Polish, Asian etc. I would expect my health to be the biggest difference in my health incurring more joint pain due to fibromyalgia. My husband would still be the breadwinner and I would still caring for the home. We keep our lives simple, and avoid debt so no unnecessary money worries other than normal ones such as the high cost of living and fuel bills etc.
