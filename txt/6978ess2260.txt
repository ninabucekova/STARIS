			 I expect I will be working although I would rather not be - personally I feel that there are too many things I want to do but I've got to pay off the mortgage and help both my children get through university and start their own lives on this very unfair financial playground. I need time to think things through and to spend time with the people I love - read, play music, talk to people. There are always worthwhile issues to get involved with and loads of knowledge to acquire - I hope I'm in the university of the 3rd age + doing lots of travel but I expect I'll be working. Healthwise who knows!!
