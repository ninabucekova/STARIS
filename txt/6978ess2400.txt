			 Up at 6 again this morning. How come animals sleep more as they get older and we sleep less? Work at 8:00 as usual though I seem to spend far more time in the office than on site, (not particularly happy about this). Still, the job is still interesting and fulfilling. Training after work and although it gets harder each year to get race fit its nice being out there on the sea (coxed fours rowing) and the social is good. Home at 7.30pm, dinner bottle of wine, book, bed at 11.30pm. Life is good, though looking forward to retirement in about 15 years .....ish
