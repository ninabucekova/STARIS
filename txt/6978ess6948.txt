			 I am enjoying the fact that the kids are now gown up and making their own way in life I am looking forward to being a grandad and continuing to help our kids and being supportive I enjoy doing the job I can choose to do without the financial pressure of having to do a certain job or pursue a career The freedom to travel and discover my own country and countries further afield gives me a lot of pleasure. It is nice to see my wife having more time for herself after years of bringing up the kids and the house.
