			 When I am 60 years old. I hope all my four children will be healthy and happy. That I will be happy, healthy and in a good kind relationship. That work continues to be fulfilling and that I have enough money to retire comfortably* I will still be loving my relatives & hopefully not have lost too many. I will still be enjoying my garden, reading, visiting other gardens & the theatre. I will be in a smaller house surrounded by family. I will still be fulfilled at work. I will still have lots of laughs & fun. *sorry the top few lines are more of a wish list - what comes after is where I think I will be.
