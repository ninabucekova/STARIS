			 Still working normal working week. Still involved with local Cricket Team. Still skiing and walking, cycling with my son (autistic) and riding my motorcycle on warm sunny days. Happy at work and at home, relatively fit - although hearing loss a problem. At home with wife and son, weekends in the garden - skiing holiday and maybe sunshine holiday (for wife!) Like to tour around Europe on my motorcycle. Still going down the pub weekends, still living in this area - absolutely no intention to emigrate.
