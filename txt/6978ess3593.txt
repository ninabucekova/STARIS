			 I am living on a narrowboat with my husband & dog. Half of the year we travel the waterways (summer!) During the winter we go somewhere warm for a holiday. I see my sons, their wives and children as often as possible. As least one weekend a month (where possible) we have the grandchildren to stay over to give their parents a break. My husband, the dog & I enjoy walking. I have two kinds of arthritis but I try to get as much pleasure out of life as I can.
