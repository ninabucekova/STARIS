			 At 60 I would hope I would not be working and would have more time to explore interests or oppotunities. I would anticipate that at 60 plus I maybe involved in helping care for grandchildren possibly and this would inevitable constrain my free time, but not in a the same way as working for an employer does. I would like to have free time to pursue some things such as getting to grips with a computer, learning to swim, playing the piano. My youngest child would be leaving home when I am 60 to go to university and this will require a lot of adjusting to. I feel it is impossible to predict what may happen to my health, but I feel it is inevitable that I will not be as healthy due to the ageing process
