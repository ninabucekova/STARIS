			 I shall be retired and looking forward to enjoying holidays outside school holidays (I am a teacher). I plan to travel in England and abroad. I expect to enjoy my house which I have been decorating for 15 years and expect to finish by then. I expect my friends to be around and I will enjoy more time with them. I would be tempted to take part time employment but do not look towards something that would tie me down. I have the opportunity of a good pension and have paid AVC's to enhance this. Consequently I expect to be living within my means. I could always downsize the house if financial problems raise their heads.
