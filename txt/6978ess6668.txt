			 When I am 60 I will take plenty of country walks, potter about in the garden, continue to go dancing and to the theatre. I have taken up an interest in painting for pleasure. It is just my husband and I at home, my eldest has a good job and my youngest is at college. I am in good health except from a few aches and pains with my arthritis. I regularly go walking, swimming & dancing to keep fit. I have just finished working as a part time Radiographer.
