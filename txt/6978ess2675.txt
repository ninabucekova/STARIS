			 The children have all left home but we all still keep in touch, I love the grandchildren. We have moved near the sea. I still work as a teaching assistant, part time, in a smaller village school. We have a dog and go for walks on the beach. I probably have arthritis but I'm fighting it. I still love music and the outdoors. I still have many years ahead of me.
