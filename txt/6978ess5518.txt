			 My wife and I are now 60, still working but looking forward to retirement. We have moved to a new house, downsizing but for a better location and bigger garden. We both like to travel and want to see the world while we can. Health is generally good still, fittness and exercise still being important. We have grand children that we we like to see as often as possible. Interests still include photography. DIY, gardening astronomy and cycling. My job hasn't changed much however the company has changed a lot.
