			 Because of personal circumstances I don't want to imagine what my life would be like in 10 years time; therefore I can only write about what I can hope and aspire for. My son has become a successful doctor in the field of his choice. He has married a wonderful young lady who has become as well as a daughter-in-law a good friend. Hopefully grandchildren will arrive that I can dote on and although the family might live away, will be in regular contact and visits. My voluntary work will continue and friendships from a variety of sources grow. Pensions will be coming to fruition to enable me to perhaps take up new ventures. Hopefully my health will enable me to continue with my art and craft work, gardening and other hobbies. Being the youngest of four siblings I hope they will be around to give the support we all give to each other at the present time. Wonderful memories of 50 years and hopefully at least another 10 years!
