			 Hopefully I will be able to afford to retire at 60! If not, I may do some part time / supply teaching. I hope that I will still be healthy and able to pursue my interests. I would like to do further education - maybe psychology and I would like to do some voluntary work at the hospice where my dad and brother died quite recently. I would like to lose some weight & increase my fitness levels. I keep promising myself but don't seem to have the time. I would also like to travel!
