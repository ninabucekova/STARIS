			 Nearing retirement in a few years, "I would hope that I still have a job in office work" and not being unemployed as at the time when I was fifty. That I am in good health for my Age and that none of my Medical problems have got worse and that I have good eye sight still with my glasses. Still able to do the Cooking, Cleaning, Enjoying Holidays and carry on with my family History research. I just hope we have a decent pension when I retire in a few years time and have enough money to pay for Gas, Water & Electricity.
