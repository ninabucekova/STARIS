			 I will have taken early retirement about now, but may be doing some consultancy work or perhaps a Phd. I will be reading a lot - mostly history and classical novels though I will have time to tackle some science fiction trilogies as well, I'll have a lot more time to spend in the garden and will have got around to fitting some water buts to help with climate change. I hope to grow a lot of my own vegetables. I'll be pleased to see my children at weekends - and maybe some grandchildren by then. My husband and I will take lots of short breaks around this country and Europe to tick off more places in our "1000 places to see before you die" book. I'll rediscover hobies of my youth such as painting, knitting, dressmaking etc.etc
