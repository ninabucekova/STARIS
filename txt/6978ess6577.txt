			 I Dont Know what I will be doing when I'm Sixty, I dont think I'll be working, with children in my own home, I hope to give up work by sixty. I would like to move somewhere by the sea, and near my sister, that we can grow old together, also I would like to give up smoking, also I would like to meet someone so I can enjoy my later years, going out and having someone to talk to in the evening. I just take each year as it comes and make the best of it. PERSONAL
