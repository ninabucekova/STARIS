			 I can only imagine my life at sixty being the same as my mum's retired and at home all day on my own with no longer my husband as he died and with no proper support (money ect.) The truth is my mum married an alcholic and second time round so did I without knowing and over the years things have got pretty bad and I think I will end up the same a lonley old woman in a one bedroom flat with not a lot to spare but will have my grandchildren whom I adore but at least I no I am loved.
