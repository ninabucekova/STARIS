			 I lead a varied life socializing with friends. I spend time gardening spending time with my husband, Daughters and Granddaughter. We have frequent mini breaks and holidays. My hands can cause me problems as my joints are arthritic, but I try not to let this deter me from doing the things I enjoy. I intend to go to work abroad for the winter season as a holiday rep for mature people. As we have been mortgage free for the past ten years money is not a problem.
