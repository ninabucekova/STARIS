			 My interests are basically the same as now I am 50, I only hope my health allows me to carry on with dancing, golf, badminton and keeping fit. I shall probably still be doing drama which doesn't require much fitness. I hope to still be in full-time employment in a similar job to that I am in now, which gives me lots of free time. I am hopeful to be in a loving, caring environment with my current partner. In 10 years time I may be a grandmother which is a liitle scary, but at 60 I will probably be ready for that commitment, I will enjoy helping my children in looking after their children.
