			 With my husband having retired 6 yrs previously, I hope that our plans & dreams have been met. (we have planned to live between south africa, {COUNTRY Europe} & here) I would pray that our health is excellent & that we are able to still drive , do the gardening DIY & housework & some sport activities: That our children are happy & healthy & perhaps have given us some grandchildren which I would love. That we still have our immediate friends around us, who being of similar age I would hope are well & healthy. That all my sisters are happy & in excellent health, & if possible that my mun will still be with us, (perhaps she will be living with me by this time.)
