			 When I was young I often wondered what it would be like when I got old, Here I am now 60, doesn't feel much different from 50. Yes the back hurts a little more & I am not as fit as I was but I am doing just fine. The church cafe is running great who would have thought it would be such a success when we opened 10 years ago. It's great meeting people & helping them cope with life issues. Gives one satisfaction knowing that others can benefit from hearing your life experiences & how you coped & got through the difficult times. It's just great to help. Home is great especially being married to an incredible woman who cares and gives so much, she's one of a kind just amazing. Could never have coped without her. Fishing is still great, but seems to be colder at nights perhaps it's just me getting old.
