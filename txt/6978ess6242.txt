			 At 60 I hope to be as active happy and contented as I am today and see no reason why this should not be so. With the love of a good man and support of my family my life now and at 60 looks very good. With me health is a case of mind over matter I dont let things get me down. The job I have now is mine as long as I want it so I have no financial worries now or in the forseable future. 60 holds no worries for me.
