			 Relaxing back in the warm sunshine I am so pleased I left the gloom of England so far behind. I do not miss the grey weather, the arthritis threatening in my 50's is gone and the active lifestyle here keeps me fit, healthy & happy. Nor do I miss the anxiety caused by ever-rising fuel bills, crippling taxes & rapidly shrinking returns on my savings. Here I know I can access medical treatment if I need it and can safely walk or go anywhere without fear of violence or being mugged. My work with the environmental conservation programme is stimulating and rewarding and makes me feel valued, unlike the years spend in low paid health care in the UK and when I am finally too old to work at all I know I won't have to worry how I'll manage, as my mother did, as I have my own house within a community that cares about and respects each other; where there are amenities for all and clubs, social activities and meeting places for any age and culture, so old age is not the lonely, frightening prospect it is for many that I left behind.
