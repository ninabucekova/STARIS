			 I hope that I will have paid off my mortgage. I am living in a smaller home, paid for, cheaper to run. As long as my health permits, I will continue to work part time. My interests are church activities, lacemaking & perhaps some study - maybe I will be trained as a spiritual director /counsellor which would be a source of income. My family (sisters & neice & nephews etc) live a long way away - but I get to visit them regularly.
