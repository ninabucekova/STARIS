			 Since my youngest son turned 18 (6 yrs ago) I have spent an increasing amount of time in Africa teaching literacy computer skills & health & hygiene. May aim is to find work in Africa to finance working as a volunteer for the rest of the week. I feel very strongly that the developed world owes the undeveloped world a lot because we have kept so many of the available resources to ourselves. I see this as part of my remit as a child of God & a part of spreading the gospel.
