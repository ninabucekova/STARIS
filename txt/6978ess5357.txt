			 When I reach the age of 60 I would like to be retired. If I have not retired then I will be running my own business. Having my own business will allow me to be more flexable, with regards to my future plans. My youngest daughter will be 18 years old and planning her own life. I hope to own a place in the sunshine (FRANCE) and enjoy time with the family. I enjoy playing golf & intend to play as often as I can. I will also like to travel with my family around the world and support them in any way I can in the future.
