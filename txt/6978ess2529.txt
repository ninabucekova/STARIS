			 At 60 I expect to be retiring from work on a pension. To be spending time in France at my caravan (mobile home) with family and friends. Enjoying swimming + walking with friends and family possibly being a Grandmother, and helping my children with their homes and families if needed. One can only wish for continuing good health for myself and family as this obviously would determine the future.
