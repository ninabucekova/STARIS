			 My main in interests are archeology and metal detecting but due to poor health I can no longer participate in these activities. Although my husband is 13 years older than me, I hope that we are still together and can continue to lead a comfortable and enjoyable life as we have always done. Due to the economic problems we may be forced to review our expenditure. My health unfortunately will only get worse and I will have had Depression for 45 years by then, so I will find it worse I expect, in dealing with problems and day to day existence. I have been diagnosed with Fibromyealgia (painful joints and muscles) which cannot be cured, only strong painkillers can help. I expect to be finished from employment shortly. I cannot see myself holding down a full or part-time job again, but I may be able to do some voluntary work. Who knows? If I reach the age of 60, considering all the above, it may by that by then I could find myself living alone. I hope that this will not be the case as I have a strong fear of living alone as we have few friends and family.
