			 Being an 'older' mum my beautiful daughter will be about to embark on a 'gap year' or be looking at going to university. She will be 18. Having been made redundant I am hopeful that having qualified as a trainer I am still working giving training in Health& Safety. We will still be living in the same lovely home - that by now will be decorated to my liking and a new kitchen in place - plus our garen will finally look fabulous. My husband would've retired but will be working as an open university lecturer. I would by now have been given the all clear from the breast cancer I had in 2006. I'll still be doing yoga and swimming and my husband and I will be taking those dancing lessons we've always spoken of. We'll hopefully be going to the cinema and theatre more and generally having a good time - making up for the past 3 years that have been quite horrid!
