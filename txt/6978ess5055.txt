			 I am still living in the same house. My husband has retired and we are travelling a lot. We may just have done a "gap year" travelling and doing voluntary work abroad. I will still be a regular magistrate, playing golf, walking, cooking, playing bridge (possibly!) doing suduku, possibly other voluntary work, and gardening. I might be organising a wedding or 2!! We will be spending time in London at our flat doing cultural bits (opera & theatre specifically) The children I hope will be coming back for Sunday lunch from time to time but who knows!! I write the above with confidence and some trepidation as it is tempting fate......
