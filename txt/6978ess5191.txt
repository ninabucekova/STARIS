			 Hopefully I will be doing more hill walking as I would have lost a lot of weight and am now more mobile & have more energy. I will proberbly still be at work as I will have to work till I drop unless I have won the lottery in which case I shall do some white water rafting my be in Canada. I may even have a partner stranger things have happened. I hope I will have all my marbles and not be dependent on anybody else. If I am depending on other people just shoot me and have done with it. Hope to be working with a search & rescue team if I am fit enough. TV and music will still be a feature in my life music more so. I could ramble on but am OUT OF ROOM.
