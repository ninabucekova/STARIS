			 I hope to continue to work at an interesting job as I find this mentally stimulating and provides social interaction I don't always get elsewhere. I fear that my lifelong love of active sports may have to change as my joints are now limiting my participation to lower levels/frequency. I expect I will see less of my children as they develop their own lives, but I hope to remain regularly in contact with them and be involved in their aspirations & dreams. I hope my husband and I continue to find happiness in each other.
