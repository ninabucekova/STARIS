			 At the age of 60 I want to be retired and not working full-time, not paying any Mortgage and drawing pension. My son would be grown up and educated and doing his own things. I still will be in very good health, diving, and going to the gym. I also want to be travelling and seeing lots of new places. I want to be financially independant and have a stress free life.
