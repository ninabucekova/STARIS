			 I am leaving a busy, active like! I am still working full time as an occupational therapist but am considering reducing my hours to allow me more lesiure time. My children all have their own homes and I am in regular contact with them by telephone and e-mail. We see each other when we can! I still go to the gym several times a week and enjoy going for walks at the weekend. Over the last few years I have started to travel more, exploring the world with my partner. I have a good social network and many varied interests including sewing, computing and photography. Although I live with my partner I have retained my own home (which I rent out) to ensure my on going financial security. Life is good!
