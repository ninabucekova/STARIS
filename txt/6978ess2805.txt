			 I enjoy watching TV and listening to music. I set out when I can and enjoy quiet days along the seaside. I live alone but get home help and occasional visits from relatives. My overall condition is deteriorating due to diabetes. I am retired with a civil service pension and various allowances. I get by but wish my life could be fuller. I miss coastal walks but still enjoy fresh air when I can.
