			 I am enjoying my part time job, and when I go home I can forget about it. I have time to spend with my children & their families & I am also finding fulfillment in participation in church activities. My husband & I enjoy working together & spending time together, we have a strong network of a few close friends & make time to spend with them. Our home is still a busy place as we are involved in setting up new projects in the church & giving hospitality to people. We love being with people & sharing encouragements & passing on lessons we've learned. I enjoy networking via the computer with our friends all ove the world & we now have time to visit some of those who've been wanting is to go to them for a long time. Our outlook is broadening, not narrowing as we get older.
