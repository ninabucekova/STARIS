			 As a single person I find it difficult to perceive what life would be like at 60 yrs old. I would imagine that I would still have a very happy home-life and would love to be a grandma at that age. I would like to be doing some kind of work that benefits people or working with children. My interest would probably be walking, reading etc. As regards my health I find that as I suffer from arthritis in my neck and back I find it difficult to imagine what I would be like at 60, otherwise I hope I would be generally quite healthy.
