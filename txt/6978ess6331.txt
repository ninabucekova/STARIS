			 I imagine life at 60 to be very much like life at 50. I will be working longer - I now only have a part time job because of family commitments. My husband and I will be able to travel more often and maybe live overseas. I will have no family commitments re - children or elderly parent. I expect to be more physically active and have more time to exercise and care for myself, more freedom. I will continue to be self-employed.
