			 60 YEARS OLD, HOME LIFE BASICALLY STILL THE SAME. STILL WITH MY WIFE, STILL ENJOY SPENDING AS MUCH TIME WITH MY KIDS AS POSSIBLE. BUT NOW SHARING THAT TIME WITH GRANDCHILDREN AS WELL. INTERESTS ARE STILL FOOTBALL (WATCHING) AND FISHING. STRUGGLING MORE NOW PHYSICALLY TO CARRY ON WORKING HEALTH PROBABLY NOT AS GOOD AS IT COULD BE BUT WILL KEEP ON GOING AND HOPEFULLY ENJOY WHAT LIFE I HAVE LEFT.
