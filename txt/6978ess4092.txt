			 Home life - smaller house, easier to maintain by the sea. Calmer and quieter as all the children (5) will have left home. Will feel a little empty though hopefully the children will visit with grandchildren. Health - in some ways better health as moer time to look after myself, not so stressed out trying to fit so much in. Physically - probably more aches, pains and stiff joints. Work - not in paid employment though may do some other work (tutoring). I will be doing some kind of voluntary work as I cannot see a need and not do something about it. Wellbeing - able to spend time on hobbies. I will be less stressed as it has been hard bringing up 5 children. Will feel sad also -'empty nest' syndrome.
