			 I WOULD HOPE TO BE STLL ENJOYING FISHING BUT PROBABLY RIDING MY MOTORBIKE WOULD BE A BIT DIFFICULT DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC NOWADAYS & FLEXABILITY AS I GET OLDER. BY THE TIME IM 60 THE HOUSE SHOULD BE PAID OFF (MORTGAGE) SO THAT IS A BIG RELIEF WETHER I WILL STILL BE WORKING IS DIFFICULT TO SAY BUT I HOPE I AM STILL ACTIVELY WORKING & NOT RELYING ON A STATE PENSION (IF THERE STILL IS ONE) I HAVE A PART PENSION FROM B/GAS WORKED THERE FOR 24 YRS. AS LONG AS MY WIFE AND I CAN LIVE COMFORTABLY IN OUR OLDER AGE THINGS WILL BE FINE AS FOR MY SON WHO KNOWS WETHER HE WILL BE STILL LIVING WITH US IF NOT I HOPE HE IS NOT FAR AWAY. HEALTHWISE I HOPE MY WIFE AND I ARE STILL O.K. & THAT THE WIFES ARTHRITIS DOESNT GET ANY WORSE STABALIZED AT THE MOMENT.
