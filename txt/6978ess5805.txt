			 As the manager of a home for older people my job is not only important to me but a privilege. I look forward to going to work each morning. I have a full home life as we have 2 children and 6 grandchildren whom we adore and enjoy spending time with. I have a circle of close friends which we meet for theatre trips, meals out etc, and we spend time at each others homes for evening meals every 2 months or more. We enjoy 2 holidays a year abroad, and Weekends away in Britain. I suffer from P.B.C which may affect my well being as the disease progresses.
