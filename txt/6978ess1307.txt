			 ONE OF MY GREATEST PASSIONS HAS ALWAYS BEEN FOOTBALL AND I STILL ACTIVELY GO ALONG WITH MY DAUGHTERS TO WATCH LIVE FOOTBALL MATCHES. I ENJOY SOCIAL DRINKING WITH MY FRIENDS. I TRY TO LOOK AFTER MYSELF AS BEST I CAN. I ENJOY MY WORK AND HOPE TO SEE IT THROUGH TO MY RETIREMENT. I REALLY ENJOY MY HOME LIFE SPENDING TIME WITH MY PARTNER.
