			 So long as I have good health, then I shall continue to work as a Driving Instructor and in my free time continue with my hobby of walking in the Preseli Hills and beyond, taking photographs and enjoying the countryside. Without the good health, the other wishes will not be possible. Ill take each day as it comes and Thank God For it.
