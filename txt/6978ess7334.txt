			 Well, now I am 60, life is decidely different from when I was 50. (although I'm not saying I'm 25 anymore. I'm now 30! I have met and married my husband and we share a home together, both having decided to retire early. although I worked part-time and did locum work following early retirement, until recently. Thankfully my health overall is better, having lost weight my back and neck give me less problems and less stress and medication have reduced my migrane attacks. I'm still promising myself a 'tummy tuck'. Due to retirement and pension, I am able to travel more and enjoy especially spending time in sunny climes. I enjoy some voluntary work, help with areas of my church and still enjoy seeing friends and keeping in touch with my brother who is disabled. I also enjoy the dance classes I started recently and still help with the Youth theatre at church that I've said I'll stop for the last 10 years.
