			 I would hope that by the age of 60 I would have given up full time employment and found my ideal 'job' by making a living from "Personal investing" giving me the freedom to enjoy "quality time" with my wife and step-family. Alternatively, I would hope to be involved in running my/our own (family) business. I would also like to have the time to be involved in local/community affairs, possibly as a local councillor. This would increase my psychological well being and the rewards of "lifes luxuries" would give me satisfaction and add further meaning to my life. I would hope that my health holds steady as I will probably be caring for my wife.
