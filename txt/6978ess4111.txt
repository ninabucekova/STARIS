			 I would like to be fit enough to continue with the work that I do, mainly gardening and dog-walking. I would also like to still be able to ski during the winter. I expect my husband and I to enjoy a good social life with lots of our friends and hope that they will all still be alive. I hope that we shall be living here and enjoying the vicinty where we live. I would like our health to be the same or improved with nothing that prevents our enjoyment of life (for example, serious illness or mental illness) I hope that we have some pets by then as presently they have all passed away. I would like to have both some cats and dogs. I hope the economic outlook has not weakened our standard of living as I would find that difficult to handle not being young enough, by then, to start all over again.
