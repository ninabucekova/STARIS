			 I am still painting and exhibiting my work perhaps have become more well known in my area of work. My health is good. My youngest daughter is taking her A levels so the house is very full of young people. I have more chance to travel to work abroad. I may still be teaching. I would like to do my MA perhaps in the next 5 years if I find some funding. I continue to be involved in collaborative art projects like the one I am working on at the moment. Life is much the same perhaps it would be good to be less worried about our finances.
