			 I hope to have given up 'paid' employment & be enjoying my hobbies, travel & still be with my wife. I'd like us both to be in reasonably good health so that we can enjoy early retirement. We will be living back in the country, hopefully somewhere quiet where we can enjoy cycling, pets & each others' company. The only 'work' I want to be doing is perhaps encouraging others (younger people) with their business ventures - I'd be quite happy to be a non-executive director of some start-up companies, my local health authority & be involved with a hospice organisation. I'd like to have some quality time with my wife.
