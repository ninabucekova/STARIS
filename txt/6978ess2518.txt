			 When I am 60 my children will be 27 & 24 year old. Hopefully they will no longer be living with me and I will be with my partner living close to or by the seaside which is something I long to do. I will still be working doing a job I am happy in. Hopefully I will be able to donate more of my spare time to travel and to taking pictures as photography is my passion. I trust my health will still be good for my age and well being.
