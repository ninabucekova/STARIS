			 I IMAGINED MY MIND WOULD BE AS GOOD AS MY BODY, BUT IT IS NOT. MY MIND FEELS LIKE I AM STILL IN MY UNCLEAR, BUT WITH MORE WISDOM. I STILL AM VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH MY WIFE OF 31 YEARS. MY SON IS ALL GROWN UP, BUT IMPORTANTLY HE VISITS WITH HIS WIFE & CHILD. I CONTINUE TO BE A VRAY ACTIVE CHRISTIAN. READING RATHER THAN WATCHING T.V. IS WHAT I DO MOST EVENINGS. MY HEALTH HAS DETERIORATED, TO THE POINT OF NOT BEING ABLE TO BE PYHSICALLY ACTIVE. ONE THINK I DO REALIZE IS THAT HAVE FEWER YEARS AHEAD THAN BEHIND. OVERALL I LOOK BACK WITH FEW REGRETS, THE ONES I HAVE, I WILL ALWAYS HAVE.
