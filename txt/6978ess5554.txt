			 I am working at 'Tesco', My backaches due to the heavy workload but I have to work there due to lack of opportunities and qualifications. I need the money to pay the bills. I have a loving family and partner. I enjoy walking and my pets. Life is dull as I have little money for going out and treating myself, holidays etc.
