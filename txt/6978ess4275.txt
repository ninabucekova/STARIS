			 I imagine I will still be working part time as a nurse with perhaps another small part time job as the children will (may!?) have left home. I hope to be fit enough to be able to play tennis 2 or 3 times a week and maybe have time for an evening class of bridge or join a choir. I also hope to develop some joint interests with my husband - spending more time together. I think I will be worries by a shortage of friends - especially if the children are at University. And I guess if my mother is still alive that caring for her may be a worry as I live far away from her. I am sure my friends locally will continue to offer great company friendship & support.
