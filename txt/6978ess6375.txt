			 Ideally I would like to be retired by 60 but cannot realistically see this as my partner of 8 yrs & I are desperate to move house to a larger property and of course this means and increased mortgage. I would still love to be playing my favourite sport, tennis & taking part in other activities such as keep fit classes, maybe golf as I used to play a while ago. Maybe by then I may need a knee replacement as I have already had an arthroscopy which showed I have very little cartilage left. Although my knee is painful at times I am not going to let it get the better of me as far as possible - maybe a new knee will give me a new lease of life beyond 60! If I were able to retire I would most definitely do voluntary work of some sort, perhaps driving people to hospital appointments, meals on wheels, focus on the elderly before I get to old myself.
