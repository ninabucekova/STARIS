			 I am a freelance therapist and work from home. I have been with my partner for 20 years and I have 2 grandchildren I help look after. I am happy healthy and have a good standard of living. I also work part time in a job I've been in for 10 years. My main interests are my close family and I also love to swim and walk the dogs in the country. I also love spending time in my garden and growing our own vegetables.
