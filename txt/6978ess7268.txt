			 At 60 I hope to be as active as I am now (or more so if I give up smoking!) I hope that me and my partner will have more time together as our work commitments won't be so demanding and his children will all be grown up. I plan to continue playing golf and have more time for other activities. I will still need to work but I hope I can continue to work in a job that keeps me interested but without all the stress I have now. I look forward to being a step grandmother and hope to feel more relaxed about everything as I get older and wiser.
