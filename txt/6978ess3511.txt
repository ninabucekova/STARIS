			 I CAN IMAGINE HAVING MOVED HOUSE TO A SMALLER PROPERTY & STILL LIVING WITH MY WIFE. I EXPECT TO BE WORKING AT LEAST PART TIME IN A SELF-EMPLOYED CAPACITY & EXPECT MY WIFE WILL STILL HAVE SOME PAID EMPLOYMENT. MY HOBBIES WILL BE LESS ACTIVE, PROBABLY RESTRICTED TO WALKING, GARDENING, SWIMMING. WE WILL PROBABLY SPEND AS MUCH TIME AS POSSIBLE IN THE COMPANY OF OUR CHILDREN (& GRANDCHILDREN?), FAMILY & FRIENDS. I EXPECT TO BE ON A PERMANENT DIET & SOME KIND OF MEDICATION RELATED TO HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE/CHOLESTEROL & ABUSE OF LIFESTYLE ACCORDINGLY. I EXPECT TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT RISING COSTS & INADEQUATE PENSION & CONCERNED FOR MY CHILDREN IF THE PROPERTY MARKET REMAINS DISCONNECTED FROM SALARY LEVELS. OTHERWISE, LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING FUN!
