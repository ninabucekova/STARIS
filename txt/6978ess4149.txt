			 I am retired - or possibly semi-retired (working part time but drawing my pension). I have time to be involved in local affairs, possibly doing voluntary work. I can attend classes to learn new skills or improve existing ones eg learn to play bridge properly and develop watercolour techniques. I will also have much more time to spend time with friends. I'm in good health - I remain physically active, walking every day, swimming regularly and going to keep fit classes (for my age group). I'm also able to go to the cinema & theatre when I wish to and can afford holidays once or twice a year.
