			 Now that I am 60 years old I have retired from the job I have had for the last 23 years. It will be another 3 years before my husband retires, after which we hope to sell up and buy a bungalow. To fill my time during the week I have taken up a voluntary post at the local hospital, 2 mornings & 1 afternoon each week. I socialize with my friends who have also retired, eg I go swimming twice a week where I meet some friends, and once a month we all meet up for lunch.@I keep my mind and body active eg: I love reading and doing sudoku and have even taken up doing crossword puzzles. I still enjoy riding my bike, weather permitting each day. My knees play up from time to time but are no worse that they were 20 years ago. I'm lucky in that I have strove to live a healthy and active life in which I am reaping the benefits now as my body ages. I look forward to the next chapter in my life with my beloved busband of 42 years, my children & Grandchildren
