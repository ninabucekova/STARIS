			 My wife and I are both retired from full time work and are Grandparents, our sons are successful in their careers, we still go to the gym to keep as fit as we can. I have regained my love for playing music and regularly play in a band. We regularly go on holidays in our caravan. I expect I will have a part time job to help pay for hobbies, holidays etc.
