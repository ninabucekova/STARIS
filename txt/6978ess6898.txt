			 I love going walking, especially along remote Scottish beaches & clifftops. I especially enjoy birdwatching & still get a thrill when I spot an eagle or hen harrier. I have lots of grand children now & they come to stay over at our house - we love having them here, and we also go to visit them around the country & abroad. I work part-time, as a HR manager for a company in Newcastle - I enjoy my job & would like to continue for a few more years before retiring. My health is good, apart from a few aches & pains. I am very happy with my life - I have been very lucky!
