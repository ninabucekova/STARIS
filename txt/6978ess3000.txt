			 I will be working part time now just a few hours each morning. This leaves more time to catch up with my reading list (so many books so little time) and gardening. Since reducing my hours at work it gives me so much more time to enjoy using our touring caravan. There is just myself, my husband and my dog at home now, and fortunately we are enjoying excellent health.
