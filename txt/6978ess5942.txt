			 My arthritis has got worse and because of lack of exercise I have put on a lot of weight and become more dependant on others. My dependancy on painkillers has depressed me greatly. My tinitous has nearly driven me insane. The children have left home and are doing well and my wife is now dedicated to my well being. I cant really see a happy outcome and would prefer for my wife not to be burdened with my care.
