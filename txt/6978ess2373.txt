			 IN TEN YEARS TIME I EXPECT TO BE ENGAGED IN SIMILAR WORK TO THAT WHICH I DO NOW ALTHOUGH PROBABLY FOR A DIFFERENT EMPLOYER. I DO NOT ANTICIPATE ANY INCREASE IN LEISURE TIME ALTHOUGH AS MY CHILDREN WILL HAVE LEFT SCHOOL AND MAY HAVE PRODUCED CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN HOW LEISURE TIME IS SPENT MAY CHANGE. I WOULD HOPE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE MORE HOLIDAYS AS THE KIDS WILL HAVE LEFT HOME. I EXPECT THAT MY PARENTS, BOTH NOW 80, WILL HAVE DIED IN 10 YEARS TIME SO I MAY FEEL MORE RESPONSIBILITY AS HEAD OF THE FAMILY AND PERHAPS A DEGREE OF ISOLATION AND LOSS. HEALTH WILL IN ALL LIKELIHOOD BE WORSE WHICH CONCERNS ME. I HAVE A CIRCULATION PROBLEM WHICH IS SET TO DETERIORATE IN TIME. CRIME AND THE BREAKDOWN OF SOCIETY CONCERNS ME.
