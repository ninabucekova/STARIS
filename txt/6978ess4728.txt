			 I am relatively fit & healthy & enjoy daily walks along the beach with my dogs. I am involved in voluntary work in the local community and help out at a drop-in centre once or twice a week. My husband and I enjoy regular weekend breaks away to visit our children and we eat out at least once per week.
