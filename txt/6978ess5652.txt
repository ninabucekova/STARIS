			 Although I continue to work full-time I look forward to the day I can retire. Now that both {DAUGHTER} & {SON} have finished at university and seem to be content with their jobs my wife and I are able to enjoy more time to ourselves and with our financial 'ties' removed are able to become more involved in our hobbies/activities we take great pride in our childrens achievements and continue to offer advice and support to them. I continue with my branch and site rep union activities with the same enthusiasm, encouraging our younger members to become activists.
