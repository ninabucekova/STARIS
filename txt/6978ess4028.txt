			 I would be financially secure both now and going forward. My children would be happy and secure and moving forward with their lives. My wife and I our friends would have plenty of free time to do the things we enjoy. I would still be working but not full time, probably in an advising capacity helping others build & develop their business. My health would be good as would that of my family. I would be less anxious about money, supporting my family & hope that the world has begun to deal with major environmental & inequality problems.
