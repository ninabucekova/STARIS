			 I moved to live by the sea a few years ago and I work in a local art gallery. I attend a few adult education classes doing pottery and life drawing. My daughter and her family will visit me as often as possible and I will be able to look after my grandchildren. My health is good and I enjoy walking along the beach every day and swimming when the weather is good. I love my garden and I enjoy painting what I see around me.
