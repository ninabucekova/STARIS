			 My partner and I moved to our present address in 2005 to lead a more relaxed, stress free lifestyle in the countryside. We plan (health permitting) to live here for the next 15-20 years, by which time the size of the property may become to much to maintain, prompting us to downsize. I'm hoping at 60 to draw on a past company pension, enabling me to reduce my working week so giving me more time so spend with my Partner. Enjoying walks in the surrounding countryside & mountains, Gardening (we grow most of our own Vegetables for the year) The occasional exotic holiday, and for myself, fishing & D.I.Y. I enjoy the line of work I'm in at the moment and can see myself with the same company in ten years time. My partner ensures we eat fresh, healthy homecooked food everyday, we walk ten miles plus every week with the dog, hardly drink & don't smoke. Adding this all up we hope to be in good health in ten years time and beyond.
