			 I am now retired from work. I retired about 5 years ago. I am in good health as I still swim at least twice a week. I have moved into a smaller house & may have moved abroad. I am enjoying doing more classes in subjects that interest me such as needlework, art & craftwork. I am travelling a lot. My children have left home so my husband & I have more time & money to visit the theatre, friends & places of interest.
