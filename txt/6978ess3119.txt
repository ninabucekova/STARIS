			 At 60 I hope to be settled in spain, having regular and frequent visits from Family and Friends. I hope my health will continue to be good, so I will be able to enjoy walking, swimming and take up sailing. I plan to do some voluntary work in animal rescue. I enjoy cooking now, and hope to be able to do more when not working.
