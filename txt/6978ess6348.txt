			 TOUCH WOOD I AM STILL HERE!! I will still be working, part-time and hopefully still able to ride out with my friend on our horses, I will have a dog to exercise and keep me busy. Me and my other half would be also actively involved with any grandchildren we would be busy, as always, with DIY, gardening, etc. Hopefully we would still be fit enough for the above!
