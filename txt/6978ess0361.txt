			 I hope to be living in a village/small town in Oxfordshire. I will still be keeping fit by going to the gym, practicing Yoga and walking. I will be growing vegetables and should have had the opportunity to retire but expect to work on a bit. I will pursue the Arts with respect to music & literature. The only reason the above would not occur (barring accidents/illnesses/unforseen circumstances) is that one or more of the children have had children themselves and I find myself looking after them a lot and perhaps they may not have left home as that is financially difficult.
