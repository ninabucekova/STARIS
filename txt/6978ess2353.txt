			 I enjoy going to watch football, meeting friends and family. My children have left home and I will have time for myself. My home will be neat and tidy and most major work on my house will be complete. I very much enjoy my garden. I work full time to supplement my state pension, as I do not have a private pension. My health is generally good and I am able to complete most tasks around the home. I manage to get away for small breaks two or three times a year. My spare time is more my own and I can please myself what I choose to do.
