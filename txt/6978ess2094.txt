				 National Child Development Study: Sweep 8, 2008-2009 
		 
			 My wife and I will have retired recently. We will be living in, or planning to move to, {PLACE South West England}. We will have "downsized" as our children will have left home. We will have a dog - probably a cocker spaniel! Our parents will probably no longer be alive so our only direct family will be our two daughters. Both will have gone through university and be making their own careers. We will be grandparents and in regular touch with our daughters. We will not have financial worries or serious health problems, so will have the freedom to travel - mainly in the UK but around Europe too. I may still be playing tennis - badly - but we will not be doing paid employment. We may do some voluntary work, like being a National Trust guide. Life will generally be good.
