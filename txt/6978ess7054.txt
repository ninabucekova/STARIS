			 I have been retired for approx 5 years. I live in a cottage near the coast in Cornwall with my husband. We have a large garden where we spend a lot of time growing our own food and tending the plants. Every day we take our two dogs for long walks along the headland and the beach. We are both in relative goo health and are very content with the life we lead.
