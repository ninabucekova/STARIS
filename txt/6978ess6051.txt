			 I imagine my life at 60 will be much the same as it was at 60. I'm still working, still full time. Having reached my career goal as a company financial controller. I imagine I'd have a similar, if not the same job as I had at 50, and not being shy of working, will continue as long as possible. Being a grandparent is now an important part of my life and I'd like to remain as an active, fun nan, involved with all the family. (Not one the kids think "Oh no the olds are coming round"). Having tried to look after my health in my 50's, I'm still fit and fortunately health is not an obstacle. My home life is always busy with social events with family & friends, a packed diary is always nice. Having been really lucky to travel a lot on holidays earlier in my 40's, I'm looking forward to still enjoying visiting other countries.
