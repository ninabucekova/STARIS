			 The mortgage is now paid and the wife and I now have a little saved for a pension. We have weekends away and enjoy walking, shopping (for grandchildren) & sightseeing. Health is good and we live a full & active life. I'm still working, but I no longer need a big income. My life is full & complete, and by that I mean we have our children around us, we're able to treat them to little things now & again, plus, the will is in place to look after my wife, and the children when she passes over. I'm content that I've done all I could for me, my wife and our children.
