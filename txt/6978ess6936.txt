			 Semi-retired and enjoying more leisure time though not as well off as I would have liked financially In good health generally though I have slowed down somewhat and do not have as much energy as I would like to have. Workwise mostly doing consultance and training as well as managing a small property portfolio. Enjoying the garden more as I do not have so many time constraints. Travelling quite a lot catching up on the places we have not visited so far. Still married and having more time for each other.
