				 National Child Development Study: Sweep 8, 2008-2009 
		 
			 I am still living in the family home. Instead of working full time I have paid work twice a week, do voluntary work once a week & freedom 2 days a week! The children have left home, been to university & have good jobs, but they visit regularly. I have more time to visit my mother who lives 21/2 hrs drive away. She is now 88 but still lives in her own home. I have more time for me - & enjoy swimming, horse riding, gardening & meeting friends for lunch. I am gradually touring the world & seeing & doing things I have always wanted to do before I get too old.
