			 IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME AT THIS TIME TO PROJECT MY THOUGHTS TO BEING 60 YRS OLD. THE REASON FOR THIS IS I HAVE RECENTLY BEEN DIAGNOSED AS HAVING PROSTATE CANCER AND AM ABOUT TO GO INTO TREATMENT, BUT FIRSTLY TO SAY:-INTERESTS + HOME LIFE:-FIRSTLY THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF MY LIFE IS MY WONDERFUL AND FUNNY, LOVING, BEAUTIFUL WIFE WHO IS MY REASON FOR LIVING. AS WELL AS GIVING ME TWO WONDERFUL CHILDREN OF WHOM I AM SO VERY PROUD OF (EVEN THROUGH THE GOOD+BAD+DIFFICULT TIMES) MY HEALTH:- I HAVE BEEN SO SO LUCKY NOT (UNTIL NOW) (50 YRS OLD) TO HAVE HAD NOT ONE DAY OF BAD HEALTH. WEALTH AND WORK MEEN VERY LITTLE TO ME (JUST A MEANS TO AN END) IF I REACH 60 YRS OLD MY OPINION WILL NOT CHANGE. THE ONLY THINGS THAT MATTER IN MY LIFE NOW & THEN, IS MY LOVE & RELATIONSHIP WITH MY WIFE + I FEEL HONOURED TO HAVE SPENT 24 HRS, 7 DAYS A WEEK IN HER COMPANY FOR OVER 20 ODD YRS AND PRAY FOR MORE THE ONLY OTHER THINGS I CARE ABOUT ARE MY WONDERFUL CHILDREN.
