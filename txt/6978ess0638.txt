			 I am working part time now, and the children will have finished university and be settled in a job. I am healthy and trying to stay fit by exercising regularly. I enjoy an active social life with many friends who I like to spend time with. I am interested in travelling and hope to have more time to do so. I enjoy going to the theatre and eating out. Myself and my husband have more disposable income to enjoy the things we like doing.
