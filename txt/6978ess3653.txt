			 I am living in the same house (to which we moved in 2008) looking after the garden and land which we have improved over the years. I am involved with some local voluntary activities but have just stopped the part time paid work I have been doing in recent years. I take a close interest in my daughter's progress at University. I am reasonably fit and active for a 60 year old.
