			 Likely still to be working abroad for much of the year, employed as a consultant on development (poverty reduction) projects. I do not know how much my health will affect my activities. Certainly over the past 10 years I have noticed significant constraints, although as yet it has not curtailed my daily activities. I anticipate that I will still be based in the village (in Somerset) where I am currently living in - between assignments abroad. I hope I will have more time to spend meeting and spending time with friends (in UK and abroad). My husband will, I hope, still be farming in {COUNTRY Asia} (ie I hope his enerprise is successful) but spending increasingly more time here in UK and on holiday abroad.
