			 Interests - I do not see this changing. I enjoy weekend/holiday walking, photography and music. My children will still be very much part of our life and I expect to be a grandad. I am healthy however I have problems with my knees which I do not expect to get better. I suffer with sleep Apena which I hope will not get any worst. We have a very good social life which is important and I expect this will be as strong then as it is now. I hope to be with my current employers in a more senior role.
