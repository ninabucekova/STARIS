			 I HOPE TO STILL BE LIVING WHERE I AM LIVING NOW. I WOULD LIKE TO BE WORKING PART-TIME AT WHAT I DO BEST. I MOSTLY WISH MY CHILDREN TO BE HAPPY AND LIVING AUTONOMOUSLY BUT VISITING REGULARLY. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MADE MORE CONTACTS WITHIN MY LOCAL COMMUNITY WHERE AT PRESENT, AS I HAVE RECENTLY MOVED IN, I FEEL ISOLATED. OBVIOUSLY THE THING I VALUE MOST IS MY HEALTH AND I WISH FOR IT TO REMAIN AS GOOD AS IT IS NOW.
