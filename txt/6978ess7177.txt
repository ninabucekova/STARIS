			 I remain happily married, We now have six grandchildren and they are all healthy. Our three children are in warm and loving relationships with their partners. I swim at least three times a week and attend a yoga class. We still enjoy walking and are going abroad on holiday this year. We continue to meet up with friends and family. We often go to the theatre in London and meet my cousin and her partner for dinner. Despite a healthy life style I continue to get my yearly Autumn virus and have infected sinuses. I work part time for the LEA in a advisory capacity. This allows me to spend time with the family.
