			 I AM HOPING TO RETIRE BEFORE I REACH 60 MY SON HAS A YOUNG DAUGHTER AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SPEND MORE TIME VISITING HER. THEY CURRENTLY LIVE IN THE NORTH EAST, SO IT IS NOT EASY TO VISIT WHILE I AM WORKING. I HOPE I CAN REMAIN HEALTHY, SO I CAN CARRY ON WALKING AND GOING OUT TO SEE MY CHILDREN AND FRIENDS.
