			 I am considering retiring from the {WORKPLACE} although at present I'm still working. I am in another relationship & on good terms with my ex-husband. My Daugher & Son are both settled & happy and I am a grandmother. My own mother is still alive and living an independant life - we still go shopping once a week & Mum still reads avidly despite a slight change in her muscular degeneration. I have over the last few years managed to shed some excess weight and am able to wear a size 14-16. I feel much healthier & happier. I still love reading, my gardening & we love to travel. I am still good friends with my ex sisters-in-law and brother-in-law & we meet up regularly with families. My ex has finally managed to beat his alcohol addiction. My youngest sister is now 50 & her MS is still much the same as 10 years ago - she is keeping well & still able to work. I still haven't had my carpal tunnel operated on. Life is good.
