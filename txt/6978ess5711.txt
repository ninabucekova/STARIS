			 I have now retired from work (HOPEFULLY) we will hopefully be moving shortly, possibly to Derbyshire. I am still pursuing my interests; railways, buses, stamps and jigsaw puzzles. Music and films are still a big part of my life too. I would like to do more DIY but my health now prevents that and I'm also not able to work in the garden as often as I would like. It's lovely seeing the grandchildren and my own daughters as often as I can. I also still enjoy walking with my wife and look forward to when we move, discovering new walks etc. I also still enjoy going out for meals with my wife. Life is much more enjoyable now. Just wish I had a younger body!
