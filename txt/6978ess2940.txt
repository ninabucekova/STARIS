			 When I am 60, I am hoping that I will be fit enough to enjoy taking part in several sporting activities, for myself and maybe with grandchildren. Work wise, I hope to find some fulfilling voluntary work to do, here or abroad. I would like to be spending quality time with my sons and their families, and I hope that I may find a companion who will bring love and laughter into my life and remove the sadness & loneliness I feel, through the unexpected breakdown of my marriage. And also that I will be able to see my ex-husband, without any feelings of hurt or bitterness! Not asking for much am I!?!
