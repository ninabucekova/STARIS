			 Now that I am 60 and having suffered from Parkinson's for about 20 years I sometimes feel very cheated from not having been able to achieve as much as I would have liked. I have a wonderful wife and 2 great boys which mean more to me than anything else. Money is a problem as I have not worked for 15 years, so no holidays, changing cars, no smoking, the occasional Bottle of wine and the odd night out for a meal. I pass the time in the Garage at my house doing small repair work, although the mind is willing I have little control over my limbs.
