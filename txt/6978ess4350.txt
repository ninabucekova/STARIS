			 I am considering taking early retirement as my energy levels are lower and I don't think I can teach until 65. I may work part-time. I have a close group of friends and we meet regularly. We go to the theatre, ballet, out for walks and for meals. I have met a man who becomes a close friend and possibly a long term partner. I have had concerns over my heart and make a concerted effort to change my lifestyle & lose weight. Both my parents have passed away within the last couple of years and I am feeling "raw". I still live alone and in the same house I continue to enjoy music (radio, concerts, CDs etc) I like to dress well (smart/casual) and still wear light make-up.
