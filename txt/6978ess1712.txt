			 Now I am 60 years old I have retired from teaching, my husband is also retired but works as a consultant from his office at home. We often go away to visit our married children and their families. They often visit us. Sometimes we go on holiday with our children, often we go on our own. We still live in the same house and make use of our garden and the nearby park. The town is close by and we often walk into town and back again. Our health is very good. I like to do some volunteer work and I also like to paint in my spare time. One of our children lives close by and we often see our grandchildren during the week.
