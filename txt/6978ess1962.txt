			 Now I am working part-time for Radical Services in HR (mainly in a advisory capacity) I have much more time to spend with family and friends, I find I have much more time to spend walking, gardening and keeping fit. I have recently taken up amateur dramatics and attend dance classes once a week, I even have time to have a pamper day now and again, my daughter and grand-daughter enjoy the time we spend having facials etc. My husband, son's and grandson prefer sporting activities, but we all love to be together socialising.
