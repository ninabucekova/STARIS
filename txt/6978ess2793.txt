			 I work part-time which gives me time to spend more time out with my dogs. I've recently taken up photography & am enjoying taking wildlife photos. My partner also works part-time which allows us to spend more quality time together. We are financially secure & can go out for lunch when we fancy. My health is good allowing me to carry on leading an active life.
