			 I am not 60 years old. I have recently retired from my job as a Teaching Assistant. My husband is still working and both of our children have left home. I still take regular exercise, several mornings a week. I am hopeing to re-start my Open University degree course which was put on hold due to work commitments several years ago. I have a keen interest in computing and gaving gained several qualifications now use mainly for personal interest. It keeps my mind active. I am enjoying my time at home but like to keep myself busy. I am lucky enough to take several holidays a year. These range from short breaks with either my husband or with friends, to longer breaks for a couple of weeks. My husband and I regularly have weekends away - we both enjoy these and come back feeling relaxed .. I am hoping to find a part-time job which would allow me to meet people and utilise some of my skills. This maybe on a volunteer basis, such as Citizens Advice or a paid employment opportunity. However, until then I am happy to just enjoy my time at home.
