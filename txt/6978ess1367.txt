			 If I could predict 10 years from now I would be able to do a job that would mean I could see into the future, I would then know if my back was going to get any better and if I could be able to work again. At this precise moment I can only see one day at a time, and how painful my back is I wouldn't like to predict anything in case it dosn't get any better.
