			 I CONTINUE MY 30hr JOB, AS SUPPORT WORKER, WHICH I LOVE, I HAVE COMPLETED MY NVQ LEVEL III. OUR COLLECTIVE FIVE CHILDREN REMAIN LOCAL TO US, ALL SEEING EACH OTHER REGULARLY AND GROWING STRONGER IN THEIR PERSONAL LIFES. HOPEFULLY, A FEW GRANDCHILDREN WOULD HAVE ARRIVED? I REMAIN VERY CLOSE TO MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS, GETTING TOGETHER AS WE DO NOW. I WOULD HOPE TO CONTINUE WITH MY GOOD HEALTH, BUT MAYBE FEEL MORE CONTENT AND CONFIDENT AT THAT AGE. I WOULD LIKE TO BE MORE INVOLVED IN ORGANISED SOCIAL ACTIVITIES, VOLUNTARY ALSO. TEN YEARS ON, I WOULD LIKE LIFE TO OF SLOWED DOWN A LITTLE, TO OF GOT ON TOP OF THINGS AND HAVE THE TIME TO ENJOY WHAT I'VE GOT.
