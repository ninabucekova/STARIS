			 WITH MY SPECIAL NEEDS SON IN CARE & DAUGHTERS LEFT HOME, MY HEALTH WILL HAVE IMPROVED AS THE STRESSES & STRAINS OF BEING A CARER HAS GONE. I WILL BE WORKING MORE FOR MY HUSBAND, OR GET A PART-TIME JOB, OR MAY BE DO SOME VOLUNTARY WORK. I WILL BE ABLE TO PURSUE THE HOBBIES I ONCE HAD BEFORE HAVING THE FAMILY, IE. READING, GARDENING, WALKING, TRAVELLING - OR EVEN TAKE UP A NEW HOBBY SUCH AS WRITING. SPEND MORE LEISURELY TIME WITH MY HUSBAND DOING OUR HOBBIES - PARTICULARLY TRAVELLING. DO WHAT WE WANT, WHEN WE WANT WITHOUT ANY INTERRUPTION FROM ANYBODY ELSE! HAVE A GRADUAL SLIDE INTO RETIREMENT, BUT BE BUSY, ACTIVE & FULFILLED - PREFERABLY HAVE MORE MONEY SO WE CAN PURSUE THIS.
