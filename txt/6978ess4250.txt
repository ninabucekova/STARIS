			 My son will have completed university and my daughter will be starting out in her adult life. My husband will still be working but under less stress - I hope to be travelling and doing more art work. I would like to see more of my siblings. I feel that my mum will be very needy or not here at all which will be very difficult for me. I hope to see my friends a lot and John my adopted son.
