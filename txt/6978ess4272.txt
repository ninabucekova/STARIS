			 We are still living at {PLACE1 Scotland} and enjoy walking in the local woodland with our dogs. It never ceases to surprise me how each season is so different from year to year which is particularly noticeable when walking regularly in the countryside. I'm getting a bit creaky but still very mobile and enjoy gardening. Keeping the weight down helps although a love of food and cooking doesn't always help. I'm doing a bit more sewing too and picking up on a few of the crafty bits I enjoy doing. I am not doing Wedding Photography now but helping {HUSBAND} more with his online internet business. All in all, I guess, pretty content.
