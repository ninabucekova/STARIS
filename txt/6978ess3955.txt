			 Now that I'm retired I enjoy having time to pursue hobbies and to keep the house clean and tidy. I finally managed to achieve a healthy weight through surgery so I can do all those things which had stopped being possible like cycling and country walks. I feel so much better about myself than I did. I like having time to be a school governor again and to join the church choir.
