			 I will be retired from my professional occupation but still working part time on something that interests me. We will probably travel more. I will pursue some personal projects with some sort of intellectual challenge - maybe resume genealogy or some research. I hope to be in good health but probably unable to run (jogging). I am worried that I am sometimes wheezy and concerned that my breathing might get troublesome.
