			 email to UNCLEAR UNCLEAR Lovely lady, Looking forward to seeing you and the family at the weekend. I will be at an auction in the morning so let yourselves in. After lunch I thought we would walk the dogs and then go out for supper with {FRIEND} and family. She now works with me doing the weddding flowers. Alls well with us, can't wait to see you all. Much love PERSONAL
