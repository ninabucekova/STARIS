			 I expect to be retired - although I enjoy my job so may reduce my working hours or take piecemeal work after retirement as and when required. I expect my health to have deteriorated unless I start losing weight right now and I do worry about this having turned 50. I hope my husband will still be well although I am concerned about his alcohol intake. I like our life now and I hope we are still able to enjoy our lives together. I hope I return to piano lessons and can sit and play a piece of music. Hopefully I will be more active too as I don't want to miss out on being with my great nephews and my (step) grandchild now on the way. I hope my tolerance with problems will endure as I've noticed as I get older I get annoyed more easily although some would say I've got too much tolerance! I enjoy my life and planning and looking forward. I have a lot to be grateful for.
