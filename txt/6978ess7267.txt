			 By 60yrs old I hope I am in a stable strong relationship. It would not matter if I was married again. I hope my 2 children are settled either in this country or here in Great Britain. They would have a job they love & relationships that make them content & happy. I hope I can still be active with my sports & enjoy a variety of new sports. My health will be fine, my back pain sorted. My job I hope will be varied and I hope to have moved sideways into a field I can expand on. I hope to be part of a community again wherever I have settled. Mostly, however, I want to be at a good place where I can look back with fondness & move forward with a feeling of content.
