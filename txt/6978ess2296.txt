			 At sixty years old I am still working part-time and mostly enjoy my job. I am thinking of retirement and may decide to retire earlier than 65 years if my investments allow. I often see my grandchildren who like to come and stay. Two years ago when my daughter left home I moved into a smaller cottage in the country and the equity from my home will hopefully allow me to retire comfortably. I holiday on average 3 times a year, usually to Italy. I am still with my partner and very happy. Arthritis has taken its toll on my knee, however it has not yet stopped my yearly skiing holiday - I am just more cautious. Life is good.
