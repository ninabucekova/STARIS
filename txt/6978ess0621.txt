			 Now I am 60 years old, I am still in good health. I have reduced my hours at work but have financial security. My husband and I are able to enjoy several holidays each year, and see lots of our sons and their families. I would hope to continue to work when I wanted to, as I find my work very rewarding. We have been able to afford a narrowboat and spend most of our spare time cruising the Inland Waterways.
