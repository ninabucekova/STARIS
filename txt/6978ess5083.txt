			 Still being married to my husband - that we are both in good health, and in love! Our children are independent adults. Hopefully retired and able to share time with family and friends, and have enough money to pay the bills plus a bit more for leisure time. Spend time in the garden and hopefully have an allotment, chilling out with a cold beer and a book. Walk the countryside with the dog and enjoy the nature around. Visit historical sites and the sea. Possibly still help out in some capacity at the local school: paid or unpaid. Maybe even be a grandparent and help in any way I can.!
