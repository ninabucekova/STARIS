			 At 60 my life will be very similar to now. Although my children will have left home and my husband will have retired from his career, my day to day life will still revolve round the house and garden. I may have grandchildren by this time so I will be able to help out with their childcare. My priorities have always been home and family and I can't see that this will change in the next 10 years. I do fear that my joint pain will become more of a hinderance, but will continue to stay as active as I can.
