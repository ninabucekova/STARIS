			 I have moved to Spain with my husband and am enjoying a very steady and relaxed life - I have no money worries and my health is excellent, and we no longer work. I my life is stress free and I am very happy. We live in a very nice house a few miles from the beach and enjoy walking, eating out, socialising and the sunshine. Our daughter (and family) are able to visit us often and so are other family members & friends - we also go back to the UK to see them. Life is comfortable - life is good. We love it!!
