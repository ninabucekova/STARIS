			 AS AN ANGLICAN PRIEST I EXPECT TO HAVE ANOTHER 10 YEARS PAID POSITION AHEAD WHICH I LOOK FORWARD TO IMMENSELY. WE MAY HAVE MOVED TO A DIFFERENT PART OF THE COUNTRY, EITHER RELATED TO WORK OR TO FAMILY. WE MAY HAD ADOPTED A COUPLE OF CHILDREN SEVEN YEARS PREVIOUSLY, AND BE WORKING TO HELP THEM OVERCOME PAST DIFFICULTIES. I EXPECT TO BE ACTIVE & IN GOOD HEALTH, ENJOYING WALKING, HOLIDAYS, SOCIALISING. TIME SPENT ON INDIVIDUAL INTEREST MAY BE LIMITED BY FAMILY & WORK COMMITMENTS BUT THIS WILL NOT BE AN ISSUE BECAUSE OF THE JOYS OF BEING TOGETHER AS A FAMILY & THE OPPORTUNITIES IN MY LINE OF WORK TO INCLUDE SOCIAL ACTIVITIES. IN THE SCOPE OF WHAT I DO. NEVERTHELESS I WILL VALUE SOME 'TIME OUT' TO INDULGE MYSELF OCCASIONALLY, BOTH WITH MY WIFE & BY MYSELF. IF EITHER MY HEALTH OF MY WIFE'S HEALTH FAILS SIGNIFICANTLY BEFORE WE'RE 60, THEN WE WON'T BE AFRAID TO REVAMP OUR LIVES ACCORDINGLY TO MAKE THE MOST OF WHAT WE'VE GOT. POSSIBLY OUR BIGGEST REGRET WOULD BE IF WE COULDN'T ADOPT.
