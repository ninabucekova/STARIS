			 My interests will be the same as they are now - fell running & racing, mountain walking, watching football etc. My home life will be very similar, married living in the same or similar house, bringing up my son who will be 14 then, spending time doing things with him. I will be very healthy and fit as a result of the increased running I will be doing which will be facilitated by my retirement from full time work. I may well be doing some part-time consultancy and will be writing my second book. I will just have started drawing my pension!
