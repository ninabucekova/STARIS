			 At 60 I plan to have retired from work. My main focus will be my family, home, & hobbies. I can see myself sharing my life experiences with our grandchildren & cooking, gardening etc. Hopefully we will still be able to travel both here and abroad. My main concern health wise is a knee injury that may curtail some of our exploits! I do alot of paper crafting which is a hobbie I should still be able to pursue.
