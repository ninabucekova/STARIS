			 I would like to be in a loving relationship with a decent man not too worried about my financial future, a garden full of flowers & veg, my children with settled futures and even a grandchild or two. I would like to be working part time in the job I love or retired. A good walk on the beach always goes down well as a treat with a nice pub lunch! A quiet pleasant healthy life at peace with myself and my world.
