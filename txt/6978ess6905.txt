			 The fact my children are not longer in full time education has allowed me to give up work, I have been looking forward to the time when I would stay at home without feeling guilty about not contributing to supporting my family. Although my husband told me to be a stay at home Mum when the children were still at school I felt it wasn't an option as we had too many commitments, especially school fees. Now I really feel relaxed and appreciate my free time. I am still busy running the home, garden and meeting up with friends, but the fact that my days are no longer spent running the children around, checking they are keeping up with their studies and meeting their deadlines. I now have time to pamper my husband, cook for him and invite family and friends over regularly to socialise without the worry of cost or time. My husband is also retired and we are travelling the world, experiencing new cultures meeting new friends and enjoying the benefits of all our hard work. Being in a position to help our children and be part of their lives is extremely important to me.
