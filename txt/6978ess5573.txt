			 I am retired, if possible with reduced stresses & strains of everyday life. I have downsized home and might enjoy visits from children & grandchildren. I have less responsibility for dependant vulnerable adults and more time to choose my social activities. My mobility may be less but well-being generally improved without tied to computers for hours & working at a pace that is almost unachievable. I may work part-time voluntary doing something I enjoy and have time for holidays & socialising lots. Keeping this up may be difficult and I may have financial worries
