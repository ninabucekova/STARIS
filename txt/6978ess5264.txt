			 I'm still working and enjoying it. No pension is a worry (self-employed) but keeping costs down helps. Daughter is 11 and nearly off to seconday school. Getting big fast. Maybe we have another child and that's a full-time job for {WIFE} (my wife). Health is reasonably good: don't drink much and stopped smoking years ago. Like cycling so not too fat. Very happy with {WIFE} and get to see friends and family a lot. A fair bit of leisure travel - my Italian is much better. Have enough money to be comfortable. Doing some voluntary work or lecturing on the side. All is well.
