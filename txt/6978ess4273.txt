			 I am working part time, (I may have reduced the number of hours) as an O.T. My husband and I go frequently for long weekends to european cities or lovely places. I enjoy walking our dog and gardening and I continue to suport our daughters with their own families/work. I may have had joint surgery to keep me active, but I look after my health though diet & exercise.
