			 We are living in the west country runnig the tea room/Gallery we have always dreamed of. The grandchildren are coming to visit. Aged between two and ten we will take them down the beach to play. Home is a small cottage or accommodation behind the 'ship' with out buildings for art studio. We have both retained good health and enjoy walking and cycling around the coastal path etc. We enjoy being part of the local community and find running the business as more of a pleasure than a chore. I can make a steady income from my pictures and we feel financially secure if not as rich as we would like.
