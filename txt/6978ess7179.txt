			 I hope, when 60, that I shall be still happy and contented with my partner. That I shall still be living in my current home, my health as good as it is now. I would like to think that I didn't need to work at 60 and be able to enjoy free time with my partner, children and any grandchildren I might have. Just to be able to enjoy life at a leisurely pace doing what I want when I want, it's a dream but a dream I would dearly love to accomplish.
