			 Too "Mills and Boon" a question for me - sorry! In my professional life I have always resisted the challenge of the unexpected, and so I look forward to being surprised by what I will be doing at 60, and of relishing the opportunity - whatever 'it' is. Hopefully we will be enjoying each other's company as much as we do now, and that of the kids - and who knows, grandkids by then. As far as it is in my power I intend to be fit and healthy. My outlook is Carpe Diem - seize the day - and live fully in the present moment, so pondering ten years hence is a non-starter! So enjoy life is not a Dress-rehearsal.
