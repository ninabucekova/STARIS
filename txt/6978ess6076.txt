			 I will still be working, but looking forward to retireing. My home is a happy place where my children can come home from Uni with friends, all are welcome. I'm still going out with friends and enjoying life. I'm still going to different countries for holidays as money is easier. My health I hope is fine and controlled and it would be nice to have lost some weight at last. Part of me is a little sad that the kids are not home all the time. But hopefully they will stay home until they marry.
