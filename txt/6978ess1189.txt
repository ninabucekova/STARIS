			 I expect to have retired from my present job and to have started on a second career of some sort. I hope to be in good health and still capable of passing a class II Aviation medical. I worry that my health will deriorate though. I expect to still be flying aerobatics although not as frequently as now and not in competitions I hope to have grandchildren and I expect to have a comfortable but not luxurious lifestyle. I may have sold my present house and downsized. I hope to still be happily married.
