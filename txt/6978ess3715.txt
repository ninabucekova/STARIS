			 At 60, I would like to be fit & well enough to lead the life I currently lead. I would hope to still be working & making a difference to the lives of others. Being in good health is important to me & I would like to be as healthy as I am at present. At some point, I would have another pet & perhaps live in the county. Generally, I am happy with my lot & feel fortunate to have my current lifestyle.
