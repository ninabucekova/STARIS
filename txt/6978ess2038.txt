			 I'M still working in a part-time clerical post, and living with my partner {PARTNER}, though we've now moved out into a small village in Sussex. We're lucky to have a garden and I'm growing a variety of vegetables to cut down in the household bills. I'm more interested, and have more time for environmental issues and do voluntary work in local groups. I've also gone back to painting and drawing in a very amateur way. We play tennis on the local courts and take the dog for long walks on the downs and are grateful to both be fairly fit and in good health. I regularly see my older brother who has mental health problems, my mother having died two years ago at the age of 91.
