			 My planned retirement at 55 did not happen. My 'guranteed' pension based on last annual salary was greatly reduced by the Labour government, to a level insufficient to support me. I am now faced with another 15 years hard graft to reach 75 and national old age pension. I should not complain. I'm fortunate to have a job now that I'm a convicted criminal (unlawfully exceeding the weekly limit for refuse placed in a local authority recepticle) and Macdonalds are not unreasonable employers. And no matter how bad the economy, the populace will always want junk food. After a 12 hour shift, what better than a spot of fishing. If I economise for the next week or two, I'll soon be able to afford a tub of maggots for bait.!.
