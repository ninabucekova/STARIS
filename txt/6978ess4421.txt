			 I WILL PROBABLY STILL BE IN THE SAME JOB, MANAGING DIRECTOR, BUT WILL BE LESS HANDS ON THAN AT PRESENT. MY CHILDREN WILL HAVE GROWN UP SO I WILL HAVE TIME TO DO WHAT I WANT TO DO. WILL PROBABLY SPEND MORE TIME FISHING AND GOING ON HOLIDAYS BY MYSELF. I MAY BE IN A RELATIONSHIP BY THEN OR MAY CHOOSE NOT TO. I HOPE I WILL STILL BE FIT AND WELL. I SHOULD BE VERY SECURE FINANCIALLY AS ALL DEBTS SHOULD BE PAID OFF.
