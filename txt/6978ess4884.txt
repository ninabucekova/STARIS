			 I expect to be living on my own with deteriorating health and fitness. I will be working, if I am lucky, in a part-time, low-paid job as I dont have the skills that are required in the 'new economy'. I expect my children to be struggling partly as I have failed to instill in them the dedication they need to succeed and partly as jobs will be scarce due to overseas competition. A possible plus is the opportunity to participate in past-times requiring limited expenditure (reading, writing, bird-watching) provided that health problems do not cause me significant problems. I expect money to be limited and that my pension to be impacted by the loss of at least one of my current pension plans due to economic difficulties. Despite seeing these problems I do not seem to have the ideas to take action to improve beyond saving all that I can at present.
