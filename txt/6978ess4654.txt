			 When I'm 60 I want to be living in spain & leading an easier life with my husband & dogs & to be warm most of the time because I feel better when the weathers good & I don't think my health will be to bad, my interests are gardening & sewing so I'd like to be still doing those things & maybe doing some sort of work.
