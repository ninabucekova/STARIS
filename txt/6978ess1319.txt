			 I would like to have moved to the coast, be working part time, with time to walk & read and spend time with Grand Children. Fewer responsibilites will hopefully mean I can be reckless. Go Sailing, Canoeing motorcycling & any adreniline filled activities I am still fit enough to try. I would like work to be more rewarding working with people. I would like to be living with Sea views in an apartment with balcony with my husband new build if possible to save on maintenance Hopefully fit enough to enjoy life to the full.
