			 I HOPE TO STILL BE WORKING IN MY CURRENT JOB AND HAVE A FEW MORE FRIENDS TO ENJOY GOING OUT FOR MEALS, THEATRE & WEEKENDS AWAY. MY HEALTH IS STEADY AND I WILL CONTINUE TO EAT WELL AND TAKE VITAMINS. I LOST MY HUSBAND WHEN I WAS 45 AND STILL LOVE HIM INTENTLY, SO CANNOT SEE ANY OTHER RELATIONSHIPS IN THE FUTURE.
