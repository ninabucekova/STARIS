			 Still happily married. The children are older (13-18 years old), so my wife and I have more freedom and the house is neater. I have slowed down a bit physically, but my health is good and I am able to pursue my interests. I am about to retire from teaching and am looking forward to doing a less stressful form of work for 5 years or so, to keep money coming in.
