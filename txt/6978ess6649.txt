			 I think I will still be working part time. My children will have moved out, but I see them often. I have contact with my grandchildren and help when needed. I travel with my husband. I think by now my mother, who I care for now, will either have died or will be in a care home. If my husband stays fit we will still be in the same house. I hope to have more time to myself so will take up swimming or walking. I also hope to be quite healthy.
