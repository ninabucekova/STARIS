			 MY DEBTS ARE PAID SO I'M NOW ABLE TO AFFORD A DECENT HOLIDAY. I AM NOW A GRANDMOTHER WHO GETS A LOT OF PLEASURE SPENDING TIME WITH MY GRANDCHILDREN. I CAN NOW AFFORD TO WORK PART TIME SO I HAVE QUALITY TIME FOR MYSELF + HUSBAND. AFTER COMING THROUGH THE CHANGE OF LIFE I'M A MUCH HAPPIER PERSON. TIME FOR MYSELF IS SPENT READING & LISTENING TO MUSIC AND SOCIALISING WITH CLOSE FRIENDS & FAMILY AS IT'S ALWAYS BEEN.
