			 I WOULD STILL BE WORKING FULL TIME (AS I HAVE A MORTGAGE & I AM SINGLE) I WOULD TRY TO CONTROL MY HOURS AT WORK (BUT AS A SELF-CONFESSED WORKAHOLIC - THIS WOULD PROVE DIFFICULT) I WOULD HOPE TO HAVE MANY FRIENDS & VISIT THEM OFTEN (AS I DO NOW) I WOULD LIKE TO ATTEND A YOGA CLASS 1 PER WEEK & ALSO SALSA DANCE CLASSES (AT LEAST 1/2 PER MONTH) I WOULD STILL TRAVEL AT LEAST TWICE PER YEAR (TO PLACES 3 HRS PLUS) AND TRAVEL AT LEAST 4 TIMES PER YEAR TO VISIT FRIENDS IN SOUTHERN SPAIN. MY HEALTH WILL STILL BE OF CONCERN (SUFFER FROM FIBROMYALGIA) & I DO THINK I WOULD HAVE HAD A HYSTERECTOMY, HIP OR KNEE REPLACEMENT. I WOULD STILL BE CHATTY, OUTGOING & FRIENDLY, NO PREJUDICES AGAINST RACE, RELIGION OR SEXUALITY. HOPEFULLY MY LIFE WOULD INCLUDE A COMPANION WHO SHARED MUTUAL INTERESTS & VALUED MY LOVE & MY FRIENDSHIP. THE REST OF MY FAMILY HAVE MOVED AWAY & HENCE FRIENDSHIPS WOULD BE OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE.
