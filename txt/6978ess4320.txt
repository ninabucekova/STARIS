			 I am still riding my elderly pony in {PLACE1 South East England} (combined age 95yrs). My cooking and gardening skills have improved. {HUSBAND} & I are still living in the same flat in {PLACE2 London}. We have made it exceedingly comfy and still love lazing about watching films & comedy on tv and reading and doing puzzles. As regards health, I expect to have put on a bit of weight (good) and be a bit more creaky. I probably won't dye my hair so dark. I expect I will still need to work but will probably cut my hours to 2 days per week - lovely.
