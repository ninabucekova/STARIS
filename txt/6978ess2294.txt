			 In ten years time I envisage that I will still be fit, running, walking, swimming, yoga lessons and canoeing! I hope to be doing some creative writing and have time for my grandchildren (Should I have any). My son will be 21 and maybe finishing University and hopefully still very involved with us at home. I will still have a love of music, reading and radio and my gardening skills will have greatly improved. I will have regular lunch dates with old friends and my husband and I will have lots of short holiday breaks. I may be considering another dog (less lively than my now young springer spaniel). I could go on....but sitting here thinking about 10 years on I feel very optimistic - Part time work of course of it is still possible.
