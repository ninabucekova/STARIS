			 I AM HEALTHY AND STILL FIT ENOUGH TO ENJOY WALKING ON THE BEACH OR IN THE COUNTRYSIDE I ALSO ENJOY READING. MY GRANDCHILDREN COME TO SEE ME MOST WEEKENDS. THEY KEEP ME INFORMED ABOUT WHAT IS HIP AND WHAT'S NOT. I'M STILL WORKING 3 DAYS A WEEK IN A JOB I LOVE, BUT I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO RETIRING. WHEN THAT DAY COMES I HOPE TO GO TRAVELING.
