			 At 60 I hope that I am still managing my chronic illnesses well enough to enjoy a good quality of life working in a well paid and fulfilling job, supporting my 3 sons in their adult life, enjoying life with my husband & friends. Having enough money to enable us to travel more than we currently do. To enjoy trips to the theatre, UNCLEAR walking expeditions, pub lunches. Spend more time in the garden, with family and friends!
