			 I'm still working & looking after the residents in my nursing home as its a job I really enjoy. My bad back gives me lots of pain & am finding it very hard to do some of the housework & jobs I usually do. Still trying to go for fast 1/2hr walks to keep my weight down. Our daughter is happy in her job & her life which has always been the most important thing, along with my husband who has always worked as hard as I do. Still haven't got much money & that will never change now but we're all fairly healthy & thats the main thing as well as being happy & complete as a family.
