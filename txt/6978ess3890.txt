			 I WOULD HOPE TO BE DOING AS MUCH AS I AM DOING HAVING TURNED 50. HOWEVER HAVING BEEN SELF-EMPLOYED FOR OVER 27 YEARS NOW, WHILST I WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO WORK UNTIL I WISH TO STOP WORKING I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE TIME OUT TO TRAVEL MORE THAN I CURRENTLY DO. MY FAMILY IS SO IMPORTANT TO ME I WANT THEM TO SHARE IN MY TRAVELS & THE GOOD FORTUNE I HAVE WORKED SO HARD FOR AND MAY I POINT OUT I HAVE NOT FINISHED WORKING YET.
