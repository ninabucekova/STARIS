			 I AM 60 AND HOOKED UP TO A MACHINE TO HELP ME BREATHE. I FIGHT CONSTANTLY WITH THE BENEFIT SERVICES TO GET WHAT I'M ENTITLED TO. I WORRY ABOUT MY DEMISE AND THAT OF MY WIFE, AND OFTEN CONTEMPLATE FINISHING MY MISERABLE LIFE. I LOVE MY WIFE DEARLY. I WON'T BE LIVING IN THE HOUSE I'M IN NOW I WOULD HOPE TO BE LIVING IN A BUNGALOW ELSEWHERE IN THE NORTH OF THE UK OR SCANDANAVIA.
