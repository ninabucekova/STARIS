			 Hope to have retired from full time work, possibly doing my own thing as a part time job, so self employed. Hope my children have found their feet in their chosen careers and we're not still suporting them too heavily.@Given some more of our own time wish to be doing more active things, walking etc, and spending even longer in the garden. Mortgage will be paid off and pensions should start to kick in so should have a reasonable income still as well as doing whatever I can part time.
