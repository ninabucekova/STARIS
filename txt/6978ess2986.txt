			 I hope that I will still be exercising, playing tennis, cycling and sailing. My involvement with my local church will continue. At the moment I work with young people. I might be working in a voluntary capacity in some other area of the church at that time. My husband and I intent to travel a little more and might do some voluntary work overseas. I enjoy my social life and my family and friends will still be very important to me. I love cooking and will still be hosting dinner parties. I imagine I might be a grandmother and I will be involved in the care of my grandchildren. I hope that I will remain fit and healthy but realise that I don't have the energy I used to have. I am a schools counsellor at the moment and imagine that I will still be counselling in some capacity as I get older.
