			 I'm still working in morrisons, my life seems to revolve around morrisons, with the hour's i work, it's hard to plan anything. I need to sort the garden out, it's like a jungle, with the weather, need to paint, and decorate, the house Just haven't had the time. I've put a lot of weight an could do with going to a gym. I've done the Santa Dash when i was 45, and a Cancer Run when i 50 which was fun. wouldn't mind doing it again. I could do with a holiday.
