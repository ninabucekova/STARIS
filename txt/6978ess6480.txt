			 AFTER 14 YEARS I HAVE NOW ADJUSTED AND ACCEPTED MY LIFE AS A WIDOW, THOUGH I STILL MISS MY HUSBAND EACH AND EVERY DAY. MOST OF MY TIME IS TAKEN UP WITH THE USAUL HOUSEHOLD CHORES INCLUDING GARDENING. I HAVE ONE DOG NOW THAT I WALK EVERYDAY WHICH KEEPS ME FARELY FIT. MY GRANDCHILDREN ARE GROWING UP SO I AM NOT NEEDED AS MUCH AS I WAS WHEN THEY WERE YOUNGER, THOUGH THEY VISIT ME A COUPLE OF TIMES A WEEK OR I MAY VISIT THEM. I HAVE A SMALL GROUP OF CLOSE FRIENDS, WE GET TOGETHER ONCE A MONTH FOR LUNCH. WE ALSO GO ON HOLIDAY TOGETHER AT LEAST ONCE A YEAR. I DO NOT WORK BUT HELP OUT DOING VOLUNTARY WORK WHEN NEEDED FOR CHARITY. I AM IN GOOD HEALTH, JUST USUAL ACHES & PAINS THAT COME WITH AGE, BUT NOTHING THAT STOPS ME FROM DOING THE THINGS I WANT TO DO. I HAVE MY CHILDREN & GRANDCHILDREN AROUND FOR SUNDAY LUNCH ONCE A FORTNIGHT, OR I GO TO THEM. I VISIT MY SISTERS AND THEIR CHILDREN AS OFTEN AS I CAN AS WE ARE STILL A CLOSE FAMILY, EVEN THOUGH WE ARE EXPANDING WITH MORE CHILDREN BEING BORN TO MY NIECES & NEPHEWS. I ALSO HAVE TAKEN UP DANCE LESSONS ONCE A WEEK AND A KEEP FIT CLASS ONCE A WEEK TO KEEP AS ACTIVE AS I CAN.
