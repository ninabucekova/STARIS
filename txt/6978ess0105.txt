			 Same interest I had when I was 30, living in same house, retired with a decent pension, good health, MORE active as not doing a sedentary job, so lots more walking. Travelling in UK very regularly, My wife enjoying as good health as is possible bearing in mind existing lifetime ailments. Still watching hardly any T.V. - listening to loads of music, playing more sport, keeping mind active. Doing volunteer driving for local community Having a really good enjoyable time!
