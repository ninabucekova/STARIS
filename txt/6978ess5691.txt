			 I may be retired but it is more likely that I will be working less days per week. say 3/4 rather than 5. I would like to continue in my current job but work less days, when I am 60 the children will have finished university. We will have moved to a smaller house closer to our daughters. Hopefully close enough to see them regularly. I will still be hill walking and cycling. I imagine and hope that my health will be as it is now. I would like to travel more often around the UK, Europe and further afield. I will travel to Australia and New Zealand. But as well as travelling I will also be doing more of the simple things - reading, having an allotment or a garden where I can grow vegetables and fruit, spending time with my wife. I will be doing more hike camping. Returning to the work time plan - working 3 or 4 days a week and hopefully having more holiday time.
