			 I am still working towards paying off my mortgage which has 6 years left to run. My wife still works and my two sons are settled into their own way of life and have families of their own. I still like to listen to music and go on relaxing holidays to {COUNTRY Europe}. I get the aches and pains associated with people my age, ie, back ache, shoulder pain and the odd palpitation but apart from that I'm fine.
