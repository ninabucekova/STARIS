			 Here I am still working full time and enjoying life, even though money is tight. I am surrounded by the most wonderful friends and family who I can always rely on for love and support and vice versa. I still love being outdoors and go walking with a ramblers club regularly, whilst also enjoying arthouse cinema and the occasional visit to the theartre and music events. I don't want to retire in the forseeable future for financial reasons but providing I stay fit and healthy I look forward to continuous employment and eventually a happy and content retirement.
