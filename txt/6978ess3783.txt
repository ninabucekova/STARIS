			 I think I will be living at the same address. My daughter will be living with her partner. I like to think we will still enjoy camping although maybe not in a tent anymore. I think we will both still enjoying our motorbikes. I will still take little 'girlie' trips abroad with my daughters. Maybe I will have altered my working hours to give myself a shorter week in preparation for retirement. I worry that my neck problem will maybe be worse, but hopefully it will stay the same. I hope to keep fairly flexible by still doing yoga.
