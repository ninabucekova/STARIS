			 I would still be working. I would still be on the School Governing Bodies that I am currently on. I would like to think I could help in the community in other ways if I had the time. I would love to be able to still be singing in a choir as I do at the moment. My children would be 20 and 23 but probably still living at home! At least they'd be off hand! My husband and I would have more time together. And hopefully my health would be good.
