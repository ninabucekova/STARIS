			 I am still working full-time I enjoying my job so well. My health is good but I am not as physically fit as I was a few years ago. I go for a drink twice a week & take grandchildren out for walks as much as possible. I still do DIY around the house & gardening 2 relax as much as possible. I also try to have holidays 3 to 4 times a year.
