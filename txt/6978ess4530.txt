			 Going by how things are now, I imagine I'll still be working & probably full time. My health is not wonderful but will still be ok for day-to-day activities My boys will both have left home & I will spend my evenings with my cat, as I do now. Not much different to now really, except that hopefully my bathroom will be finished.
