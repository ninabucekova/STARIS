			 At 60 years of age my interests and hobbies would more or less still be the same. Playing chess is my main interest and should this not be possible anymore, then at 60, depending on my circumstances a big gap would have appeared, but I'm sure there are plenty of things to keep me occupied (reading, swimming) My home life would (or at least should) have changed due to our daughter no longer being at home (17). Maybe some grand-children would have appeared, in which case my life would have altered considerably from now. I am worried about my health at 60, as I smoke and seem unable to stop, even though I've tried many times. My job at present is quite physical and my back is another concern at that age. Hopefully I would have retired by then due to us down-sizing our property. So at 60, I'm a grand-father and husband, with a healthy bank balance, still doing the things I like. I've stayed fit, so health's not to bad. Retired or part-time and still got all my own hair!!!
