			 I am still working as a GP, adapting to new NHS initiatives, & I am senior partner in my practice. I have 2 grandchildren who I see during the holidays or weekends & they play in the garden (which I spend more time in) I still enjoy studying history of art in my spare time and we travel (my husband & I) to Europe on short breaks. I still swim regularly to keep fit (& to keep my muscles in trim before a knee replacement next year) I am pretty healthy apart from the arthritis in my knee (resulting from a skiing injury in my forties). I am looking forward to retiring next year when we will travel to New Zealand.
