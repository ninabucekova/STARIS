			 Since reaching 50 I have found myself feeling very loved and settled. I got married in July 2005 with a lot of hope for the future my husband {HUSBAND} had 2 heart attacks in 2004 and it was a very worrying time but we came through it together. I work in a school kitchen it is very hard work but I enjoy it. When I return home I look after {HUSBAND} he only works parttime now. I have a little dog called {DOG}. She is 4 we take her for walks and most weekends in the summer we go to our caravan. In my spare time I like to walk, read and for about 10 years I have done THI CHI which I have found very good for me. I really love Antiques Fairs I collect Silk post cards from the war its so nice to see the messages on them. My health is not to bad we are all getting older but dont seem to realise it some days. I feel 30 some day to so when I am 60 I hope I feel 40. Many Thanks for all your hard work {N21921Eâ€™S NAME}.
