			 By the time I am 60, I intend to have a second home somewhere in the sun! The main thing I dislike about the U.K. is the terrible weather, also we are taxed to death ! So as my career has given me a good pension I plan to spend my early retirement (mid fifties) in as much sun as possible. I would still keep a home in the UK as I think there are some things (and people) I would miss.
