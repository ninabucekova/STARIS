			 I am enjoying life. I have more time to pursue my own interests and I have a job I still enjoy, but it's not so important anymore. I am healthy and happy. Tim and I have more holidays and enjoy spending more time together. We have a holiday home which we regularly visit, sometimes with other family members. I've started writing and find I really enjoy it. I still love running, walking and swimming and soend more time at my allotments. Life is wonderful - time for new pursuits and lots of new opportunities
