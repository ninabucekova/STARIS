			 When I am 60 I hope to be living in the same house with my wife. We would spend some of our time with our children and their families. We would still enjoy our main hobby which is dancing and I would have time to research a local history project I started a long time ago. I would like to be thinking about retirement so perhaps be working part-time or in a post with less responsibility. I would like to have the garden looking wonderful all year round and perhaps work an allotment. I would like to attend concerts and the theatre and enjoy going to gigs where family members are playing. I would like to be able to pass my specialist dance knowledge on to young people.
