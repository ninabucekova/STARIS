			 OK. MY INTERESTS WILL BE THE SAME AS WHEN I WAS 6 YEARS OLD - CLIMBING TREES, FISHING, CAMPING, HAVING FUN. HOME LIFE - WILL BE GOOD WITH MORE TIME TO CLIMB TREES AND FISHING ETC. IF I WAKE UP IN THE MORNINGS, THAT WILL BE A BONUS. I'LL GO FISHING AND CLIMB EVEN MORE TREES! WORK - WORK? NOT LIKELY!
