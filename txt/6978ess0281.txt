			 At 60 my home life is wonderful. I still have very close bond with my children & family & friends. I am in a solemate bond with a wonderful man. OR still on my own accepting who I am and happy with me. Health - because on the 7.10.08 I got myself back into Yoga and began to live in the moment. I feel great. My posture is better, I'm calmer within, I look good and feel great. My interests are varied I still enjoy crafting, diy, gardening, dancing (ha) flower arranging etc. Working - maybe helping & teaching mums to spend time with their children. Educating children in crafts & to be active. Helping others to be happy.
