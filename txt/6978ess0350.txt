			 To me, 60 years old is the 'new 50' and I would expect to be doing everything that I am doing at 50 - working, maybe a grandparent by then, enjoying more time at home. I intend to eat healthily and stay fit and plan to still work in journalism - though realistically it will be more part-time. As the children will have left home, I expect to have more time for holidays, reading and walking/exercise. I plan to be a young 60 - there is no reason not to do everything I am doing now - and more.
