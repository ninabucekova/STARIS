			 Providing I haven't kicked the bucket by then! I Have a bad back at the moment. through 35 years of hard building work, so hopefully I wont be in a wheel chair! I liked to be able to do all sports as I am today. I sing with 3 operatic societies ({CLUB}) so I dream of becoming a proffesional tenor! some hopes hey! Still married I hope, I have a lovely wife and three lovely children. Im changing my carreer at present time to H&S but I don't enjoy it so I would like to be doing something which pays plenty and I enjoy doing it. I love life in full and its still an adventure for me so when im 60 I shall be enjoying life to the full.
