			 Now we are both 60 we have decided to do some retirement planning. {HUSBAND} will keep the garage going but try to do less hours. I plan to try to work 3 days a week. With our extra time I think we may try to have the garden we always wanted and even do some touring in the camper van - thankfully we are both still in good health so best take advantage. {DAUGHTER} is doing well in her job & has recently moved into her own flat - life seem to be good.
