			 I would be still living in my present home. I would probably still be teaching or working. I would hope my health had continued to be good and therefore allow me to contine with my sporting interests. I would have at least one dog. My children will all be married and at least one will have had children - so I would be a grandma!!! I would hopefully have more free time to travel and visit friends/family more often.
