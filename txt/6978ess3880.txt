			 I am retired and enjoying having time to walk my dogs, see friends and go out whenever I like. I enjoy good health. I have cashed in my house and private pension and can live comfortably-albeit slight down-sized! My children are in careers they enjoy and are in stable relationships - hopefully I & may be a granny! Life is good!
