			 Both children are now at college which means we visit them occasionally but also gives us freedom to take short breaks as and when we feel like in term time. I swim regularly, go for walks with my husband (who retired a couple of years ago), eat out a lot and meet up with friends occasionally. I continue with family history research and can now travel to pursue this, I've also started Italian and water colours again. My husband and I play board games together with a small local group and he reluctantly accompanies me to a dance group.
