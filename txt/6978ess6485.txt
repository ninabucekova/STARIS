			 I am still working as an IT manager but looking into retiring early if possible. Just the two of us at home now, still see family and friends but grandkids not so keen, -(they have thier own friends). Still going to watch the football in the premier leauge - Like going out for meals - try at least once a week Holidaying twice a year and the odd weekend away. Still fairly healthy - (touch wood!)
