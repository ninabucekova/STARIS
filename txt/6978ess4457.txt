			 My life is running along similar lines to when I was fifty. We have moved to a village/small town in the country to be part of a community, and enjoy a better quality of life. I exercise regularly and enjoy more countryside walks. We are better off financially, and still enjoy several overseas holidays. We may even be looking to buy a property abroad. I still work for the same employer.
