			 I retire this year, if my financial planning is accurate. I would like to have a part time job as it is good to integrate with people and have a purpose to get out of bed in the morning. I may now be able to concentrate on improving my handicap. I have enjoyed good to reasonable health for most of my life, hopefully this is still the case. My girls are following their career paths, married, kids? I don't know! Looking forward at some point to becoming a grand parent. Still going out to restaurants with friends. Have enough time on my hands to keep on top of the gardening, can't believe I'm 60!!!
