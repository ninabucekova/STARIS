			 I am married to my present partner, we are both still working but hoping to retire soon. We enjoy good health & continue to be active, we don't live here. Our children have completed their formal education & have travelled & found their way in life. We are constantly in touch with them & our family members. There have been wonderful times & sad times but life is interesting & fulfilling. We are not well off but comfortable financially.
