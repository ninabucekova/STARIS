			 I will be retired and leading a peaceful quiet life. My husband is also retired and we can travel when we like. Children have left the family home and I never miss a quilting meeting! (once a month) We still walk our spaniel and we are both in good health. If I am doing any work it will be part time at the jewellers while {HUSBAND} is playing golf.
