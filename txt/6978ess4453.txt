			 I would like to imagine myself at 60 still Married to the same man, with grandchildren or at least the promise of them and a house in London in a part of town that we like. As I have just accepted a place on a Textile Foundation course I would hope that I will have gone on to do a degree in Textiles and at 60 am proving a career either as a teacher or in another textile field. Despite being overweight I am in good health at 60 and still walking regularly with my husband, exploring different parts of the country. I see my two children regularly and have a good social life meeting old friends for dinner and trips to the theatre. My husband is still working and has resolved the problems of ten years before. I still worry about being able to "afford" old age after the financial problems we have been through but am happy to work as long as I need to.
