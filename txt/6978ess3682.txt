			 I work with my husband in running a local small light industrial estate bought in 2006. We work from a home based office and work probably 3-4 full days a week. I keep horses and ride 2-3 times a week & join in with my riding club activities when I can - if I am able to. I travel abroad 3-4 times a year with my husband on holidays. I am still very healthy and happy. I don't see my son as often as I would like as he travels a lot and teaches sailing, but hope to live nearer to him when he starts having children - (if).
