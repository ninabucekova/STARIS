			 I'm a healthy 60 year old who enjoys walking, travelling and swimming. I write stories and poems and at the moment I'm writing a novel , based on the lives of my parents. I paint and draw and go to art exhibitions and the theatre, My husband and I spend most of our time in the Isle of Wight, but we still have a flat in London. We travel around in our volkswagen with our sons and their families - we have 4 grandchildren, who we visit frequently. I help out with reading at the village school and drive people to hospital appointments. I miss my parents, but I am happy.
