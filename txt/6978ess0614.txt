			 At last I have the time for all my interests and hobbies! It is a pleasure to still be working in a consultancy role, drawing on my experience and being valued in a modern working environment. I spend time with my daughters and their happy families, babysitting and performing a traditional grandmother role. I live in a smaller house with a smaller garden and have downsized because I want to enjoy managing my house and garden, not be a slave to it! I live alone but have a long term partner who enjoys some of the same hobbies as me. We both have a good pension to support our lifestyle.
