			 I suspect nothing much will have changed from my current situation. I expect to still be working but am unsure where that might be as I've only recently had a big change (voluntary redundancy, but was able to get another job). I hope my interests/recreation will continue to be active - I have quite a few friends who are very active in their 60s! My father died at 56 (so I hope I haven't inherited that!) However my health is generally very good (but then again, so was his!) so am hopeful that this may continue.
