			 2019 I am reasonably fit. I wish to be doing plumbing as a part time occupation for several years yet, having completed a city & guilds course nine years ago. I take an interest in cooking & DIY as I always have and I have a bit more time for gardening now the children don't take up so much of my time. I belong to a couple of societies and meet a few good friends on a monthly basis. My husband has just retired and we go on the odd weekend break as well as an annual holiday. My children are both healthy, the eldest having the job she always wanted and the youngest at university, they are both happy and my husband and I are settled and content with our situation.
