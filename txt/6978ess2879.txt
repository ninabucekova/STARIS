			 I continue to be a school governor but now at two schools. All our children have now places of their own so my wife & I have moved within the town to a bungalow. We now enjoy taking more holidays together & in particular visiting two of our children overseas. I am still generally healthy although I should really do more exercise on a regular basis. I really enjoy my work which is very important to me. I will probably have to work for 5 more years to build up my pension. However, as my employer values my contribution that won't be a problem.
