			 I continue to work part-time. My husband and I have max-time together as our daughter is grown up. We take more exercise as we have max time. The house is tidier. I am still involved with church. I see my friends at least once a month, usually for a meal. I still like going to the cinema, theatre and to see live music. My health does not restrict my lifestyle. I am still a vital part in the life of my family.
