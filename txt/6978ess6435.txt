			 I don't really envisage much change between now and being '60'. I have a rewarding job & a happy marriage - with a partner who shares my sense of humour. I enjoy motor-rallying and long walks. I would hope to be spending more time with my step-grand-children in France and would like to be able to help them financially. Of course, like most people of my age, I appreciate that the health of my parents may deteriorate and that they will increasingly need my support - which I will be happy to provide. And . . . I look forward to attending the weddings of "mature" friends who I hope will get married.
