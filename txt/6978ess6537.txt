			 I am hopefully of good health, a continued positive feeling about my friends, family. I hope to continue to love & respect my husband and we continue to do things together eg travelling, enjoying the company of friends. looking forward to grand-children . Hopefully retired so I can do some voluntary work Would like to re-start playing badminton/ tennis and learn to play the piano. Do expect some sadness; both sets of parents are still alive - not too certain how I will cope with this - Possibly will have moved, sharing my time between U.K. and abroad.
