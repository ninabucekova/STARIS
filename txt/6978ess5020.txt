			 I WOULD LIKE TO THINK MY HUSBAND WILL BE THINKING OF & ABLE TO RETIRE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS SO WE CAN ENJOY SPENDING MORE TIME TOGETHER. WE WOULD HOPE TO BE IN A POSITION OF BEING MORTGAGE FREE AND WITH A GOOD LEVEL OF SAVINGS, FOR OUR RETIREMENT. HOPEFULLY MY HEALTH WILL REMAIN GOOD SO I CAN CONTINUE TO ENJOY MY GOLF WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT TO ME BOTH FROM A FITNESS POINT OF VIEW & SOCIALLY. I ALSO ENJOY KEEPING FIT THROUGH WALKING & MODERATE GYM, EXERCISE/SWIMMING. I HOPE TO REMAIN HEAVILY INVOLVED WITH THE GOLF CLUB THROUGH COMMITTEES & VOLUNTEERING. OUR CHILDREN REMAIN CLOSE TO US ALTHOUGH NOT LIVING IN OUR IMMEDIATE AREA - GENERALLY WE MAINTAIN VERY CLOSE BONDS. I HOPE MY HUSBAND ALSO REMAINS HEALTHY & THAT HE IS NOW TAKING BETTER CARE OF HIS HEALTH THROUGH EXERCISE, DIET & HAVING STOPPED SMOKING MANY YEARS AGO!!!
