			 I feel better than I did when I was first diagnosed with diabetes. Since I retired I feel less stressed. I have more money to spend since my mortgage was paid, and my pension and savings give me some sense of security. Living is also less expensive since the kids have left home. My wife and I enjoy life more as we go on holiday abroad at least 3 times a year, we are able to live some of the things we used to dream about.
