			 My wife and I will still be together and our four children will be launched in their own lives. We will be active, hands-on grandparents, but will still be working at the same time (full-time) We will still like each others company but will also have our own pursuits. Home will remain a safe-haven for me. I think I will remain healthy and still want to run and play football. I will be in the same job as a solicitor and won't be able to contemplate retirement at 60.
