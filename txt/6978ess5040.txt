			 I'm living in the same neighbourhood. I've retired but I'm doing regular voluntary work. I'm still married and with my wife we go cycling, attend night classes and visit museums and art galleries. I'm still fit enough to go swimming, but I spend more time studying history and writing letters. I have much more time to see friends and family, including my daughters who are all away at university or working in fulfilling work.
