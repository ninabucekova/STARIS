			 I DON'T LOOK BEYOND THE NEXT FEW WEEKS BECAUSE LIFE'S EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN ME, THAT WHAT EVER HOPES OR PLANS I MAY HAVE MAY NOT WORK OUT. I AM JUST LIVING FOR TODAY, WHEN I AM 60 I WOULD ENVISAGE THAT MY PARTNER AND I ARE LIVING HAPPYLY TOGEATHER WITH THE KIDS OF OUR HANDS. WORK WISE I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT I WILL BE DOING. HAVING JUST RESIGNED AS A COMPANY DIRECTOR. I WOULD HOPE MY HEALTH IS A GOOD AS IT IS NOW OR NO WORSE. I THINK I WILL BE WORKING INTO MY 70S. IF I HAD MY TIME AGAIN I WOULD NOT PLAN FOR OLD AGE OR WORK AS HARD AS I DID WHEN I WAS YOUNGER. ITS GOT ME NO WARE. SO LIVE FOR TODAY. * NOT WHAT THE GOVERNMENTS WANTS TO HEAR.*
