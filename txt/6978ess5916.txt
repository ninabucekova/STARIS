			 I am now settled in another relationship (LONG TERM) and happy in home life. My health is still good and I am able to participate in the odd sports occasion. I am still following the {TEAM} (FOOTBALL) still stromming the odd chord or two on guitar and playing the odd gig! I am stil in contact with my children in their thirties now and their families and my childrens mother (1ST WIFE). We are all on good terms. I am able to pursue a good level of D.I.Y and gardening to keep things in order I still highly value my work and enjoy it as much as ever. Looking forward to each day both at work and play.
