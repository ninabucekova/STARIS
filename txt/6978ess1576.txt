			 Probably still working to repay mortgage & supporting youngest child through university. Although if all kids left home hopefully somewhere smaller & working part time. Hopefully still healthy & will have given up smoking at last! and walking more. Hopefully more time to myself although my sister may need more help by then. Probably still reading a lot and ingoring the housework. Maybe babysitting for grandchildren May have bought the dorma van I keep telling the kids I'll buy when they leave home & be travelling the country.
