				 National Child Development Study: Sweep 8, 2008-2009 
		 
			 I am still working full-time (since I can't afford to retire). I don't have any children / grandchildren, and I don't keep in contact with most of my family, I have a few good friends who I keep in regular contract with. My health is not great, perhaps as a result of smoking & drinking too much in previous years. I try to exercise on a regular basis. I travel to {COUNTRY1 Europe}, Italy & Spain on a regular basis (I've had a house in {COUNTRY1 Europe}for 15 years).
