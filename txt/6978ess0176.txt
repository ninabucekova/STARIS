			 When I am 60 years old the mortgage will have been paid for a few years and I expect to be working with my husband running camping & caravan sites in {COUNTRY Europe} or Scotland. The grandchildren will all be at school so my sons & daughter in laws wont need as much support and we will have more time for ourselves. I hope my health and wellbeing will benefit both of us from the change of jobs less stress more time enjoying what we like best the outdoors.
