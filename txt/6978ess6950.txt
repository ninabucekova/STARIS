			 Now I am 60 I have retired from my job, and love every minute. I have more time to myself I take a lot of exercise & take care of my diet. I have to watch money but am happier not to be working, I have more time to spend with my family and enjoy spending time with my grandchildren, also my many friends I enjoy the garden and appreciate nature more each day. I do some voluntary work something I have wanted to do for many years. I really appreciate every day of my life.
