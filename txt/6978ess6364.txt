			 I am still working (part-time) but would love to retire but am unable to due to the increase in retirement age & due to the fact that I do not have enough savings or a large enough private pension. I get tired very easily & am not as quick mentally & physically as I used to be (particularly at work). I live with my husband & youngest child, my other two children live with their partners. I have two grandchildren. My hobbie is reading. I have lots of friends & still like socialising - I have always been a 'chatterbox' & still am. I value my family very much & love the children & grandchildren to visit. I suffer from arthritis which sometimes slows me down.
