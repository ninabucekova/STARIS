			 I am now thinking of retirement and leading a more leisurly life. At home our child has left home and we are now planning our new home. My health is quite good and I can still do most things, including new hobbies of fishing & golf. This is how I would like it to be. In real life I think that retirement will not be possible, and I will still be working as now. Probably not the same work, but I dont know what sort either.
