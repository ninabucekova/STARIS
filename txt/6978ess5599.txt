			 To imagine I'm 60 years old - I would hope to be in fairly good health - I think my home life would be roughly the same & I would like to think I would still be working though I do believe in that you shouldn't look to far into the future - just take one day at a time - who know's what's round the corner. I think as long as your healthy and have a good home life & family around you - that's what would be important to me.
