			 At 60 - I hope to be still happily married; possibly have grandchildren. Moved to a smaller more easily run home - probably in same area. I would hope still to enjoy good health & be active. Possibly still practising podiatry, but in a very part-time capacity & maybe involved in some type of voluntary work. If my mother is still alive I would be very much involved in her care & would envisage this would take up a lot of my time. I would also hope my husband & I would be able to spend quality time together & enjoy retirement.
