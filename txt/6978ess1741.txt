			 I would expect that I would still need to be in fulltime employment, and hopefully working for the same company as today. I would not expect early retirement to have been an option for me in my late fifties. I will still be very happily married, and my wife and I in reasonable health, although the general aches and pains associated with growing older will be more apparent. We will still have an enjoyable and active sex life. Hopefully the grieving process for my wife and I, from losing all our parents within three years in our late forties will be behind us. At 60 we will hopefully be free from our mortgage, and still taking regular weekly and fortnightly holidays in the UK, and short city breaks in Europe. DIY activities on the house will be at a minimum, but we will still be working regularly in the garden. The occasional walk, bird watching trip or picnic will happen now and then and perhaps the odd round of golf, Christmas when 60 will mean one of our five year christmas away from home trips will be on the agenda. I will, I guess, be reflecting on my life, and preparing for retirement, with perhaps considering possible early retirement or retiring to the USA. In conclusion, I see life a 60 much as it is now a 50. However, with a little less energy and more troubles from the aging process and less need for drive and ambition.
