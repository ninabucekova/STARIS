			 I imagine that I will still be working part-time but retirement will be in sight and I look forward to travelling a lot more with my husband then. I don't imagine I'll still be looking after my mother so I shall have more time. I hope I'll be socialising a lot with friends, either going out to dinner or cinema trips as we do now. I expect the children will be in steady relationships - if not married - but can't see me being a grandmother by then. I hope they'll still enjoy coming home for the odd w/end and perhaps still the occasional ski-trip. That would all presume we're fit and well so those gym visits will have to continue for the time being.
