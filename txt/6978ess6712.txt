			 My partner and I have more time to enjoy each others company and explore the world in our free time. We are watching our children embark upon their adult lives now that they have studies / work to deal with although I imagine they will also still need support which I hope I can give them. I will be working in a more creative capacity though still linked with education. I hope to keep fit and happy - as I am now.
