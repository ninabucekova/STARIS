			 I have traced my family tree, both sides, back four generations. I have a fulfilling relationship with my partner, although we still ponder marriage we havent bothered yet. The credit union has gone from strength to strength and church is very fulfilling. My grandchildren are a joy and now I work shorter hours & fit to spend time with them. I am lucky in health matters and all in all am quite content with my life & loves and thank God I am where I am.
