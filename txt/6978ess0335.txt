			 I am working but, part time only. My house is as I like it. I see my daughter & grandson regular & take my grandson to visit places with my husband who is now retired. My health is quite good in that I am able to do the same things as I did 10 years ago. (almost). We have a nice car a have at least one foreign holiday a year and weekends away now & again.
