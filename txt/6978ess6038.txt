			 I enjoy my life, have a loving husband a lovely daughter and a beautiful grandson. I am still working and will continue to do so for as long as I possibly can. I take medication for a long standing condition but this does not stop me from doing anything I want to do. I am a golf widow and have been for many years, although as a couple, my husband and I enjoy various activites such as holidays abroad, the theatre and meals out.
