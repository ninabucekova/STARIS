			 Still trying to loose weight!! Still loving my art, gardening, walking, reading & good food & wine. Still hopefully able to live in my house. Oh and still studying and embracing new ideas & technology. My creative life is very important to me so I would hope to still be active in my work. As for health, well I suffer with Bipolar disorder which I hope to still be keeping under control the best I can. 60 is just a number, I may be a crusty on the outside....inside lays the heart of a young girl...he he!!
