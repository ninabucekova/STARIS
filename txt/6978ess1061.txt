			 I am planning to reduce the amount of work I am doing. I would like to retire in a couple of year and getting used to the extra time doing the thing I like to do will be important I have slowed down a little in the last two or three years, But going to the Gym and walking is helping me feel better. I am glad I got my wife {WIFE} to have the injections that made it posible to go on the holidays to Africa, Asia and South America. I have just been able to get a small allotment near home and I am look forward to growing my own Veg. {WIFE}s age being 6 years older than my is starting to be an issue when planning trips etc.
