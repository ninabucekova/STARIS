			 OKAY, I'm 60 YEARS YOUNG! MY IDEAL 60TH B'DAY WOULD BE TO CELEBRATE IN MY NEW HOME IN A WARM COUNTRY. RELAX KNOWING IVE NO MONEY WORRIES, THAT MY WIFE & SON ARE BOTH HEALTHY & BY MY SIDE, ECONOMIC GROWTH IS HEALTHY WORLDWIDE & MY SON IS ON COURSE FOR A BRIGHT FUTURE. I AM STILL IN LOVE WITH MY WIFE AND WE BOTH ENJOY A SOCIAL LIFE TOGETHER. WE ALL HAVE FAMILY & FRIENDS STILL TO SHARE IN OUR UPS & DOWNS OF THE DAY & LOOK FORWARD TO MY 70th.
