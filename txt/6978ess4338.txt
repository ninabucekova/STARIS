			 I would have a holiday with the lump sum from my pension and try to enjoy myself more than I have in the past. I still read a lot of books and would like to take up horse riding again. I love taking care of my husband and keeping him safe. At home my husband is still doing his D.I.Y. and I enjoy looking after our animals. I would have lots more animals if I had the space and money to take care of them.
