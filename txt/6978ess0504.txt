			 I may still be working aged 60 but only in a job that I find fullfilling and only working part time hours. I would hope that my husband will also be working less hours and we are able to spend more time together - walking in the countryside. I imagine I may be living in the same place although living in the countryside remains a dream! I hope that I will remain reasonably healthy & will be making an effort to eat healthily & take regular if gentle exercise. Maybe I will achieve one of my ambitions of writing a novel or undertaking an open University course in History (?) Certainly I shall still be answering questions for this study!!!
