			 At 60.... I have just retired. I spend a lot of time caring for my elderly mother. My health is fair, and I enjoy gardening. I don't see my friends as much as I did. I don't imagine myself being either happy or content. The environment and world situation is grim. But I'm luckier than most. I regret missed opportunities and feel that I could have made a better fist of things Hey ho.
