			 I am a fully qualified solicitor, who is very happy & satisfied with my life. I am very happily married. I am working part time & have several holidays abroad every year. People are always surprised when I tell them how old I am as they do not think I look it. I have inherited my mother's genes & I am very fit. I realise how lucky I am & know that my life has always been blessed.
