			 With my husband we will have the time and financial stability to travel extensively. My health should be reasonable as the stress of business and family responsibilties will have diminished. I am hopeful that my children will have found partners to be happy with and if they go for having a family will bring their children into a stable married relationship. I look forward to having been married to my husband for 35 years and my two children providing me with grandchildren. I look forward to the building project which has taken up the last 10 years of my life being complete and therefore realising the home of my dreams.
