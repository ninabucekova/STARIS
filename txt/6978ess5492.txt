			 I am 60 years old. I have retired from the police. I have a good pension and hopefully in good health along with my family. I spend a lot of time near the south coast in my caravan relaxing and doing what I want in my own time my wife has also retired & we share time together. Both the Children are happy with their lives and have good jobs. I may consider getting a part time job locally to pay a few bills but only 2-3 days a week which will enable me to meet other people (the local B & Q would be good). Time is mine - Fishing, walking, visiting family and friends - Posibly do a bit of travelling around europe if not further. Having said this, i'm sure that progressive goverments, Decisions, shop prices and my Health could change everything, I hope not!
