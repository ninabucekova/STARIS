			 I am so glad we moved to the countryside a few years ago. I enjoy walking by the sea. Since we both retired a couple of years ago we have time to explore the area. We're involved in the local church and have made some good friends. The grandchildren visit often and we love taking them out. It's now nearly 15 years since I had cancer and I feel better than ever. I have more time for the garden and we also like to travel whenever possible and see new places.
