			 I expect to be living in this house. My husband will be on the point of retiring. I hope to work part time or do voluntary work. I expect we will still have a dog and go for holidays in this country in our campervan. I will be an active church member and enjoy my hobbies of spinning and weaving. I expect my activities will be more difficult because of progression of my rheumatoid arthritis. I expect both my parents will have died and hopefully my sons will be married and I will have some grandchildren. Money may be more of a problem as I don't have a pension or any savings but we do own our house outright. I would still like to learn new things by going to evening classes and stay active physically.
