			 Working at B&Q because no one will employ a 60 year old in an engineering job. Having to work because my pension company has collapsed, and I have re-mortgage the house to live. I do DIY to keep the costs down around my home. Occasionally see my children. Still living with my wife who has similar problems. We may have emigrated.
