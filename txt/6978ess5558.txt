			 As I look back I feel a few regrets for things that I may have done differently or handled situations better than I did, but on reflection I feel I have made a substantial difference to my family by simply being around when needed. I've always worked, never in highly skilled or highly paid jobs but always helping to furnish my family with nice things and occassional treats we wouldn't of otherwise had. All in all I feel I've been a law abiding, reliable person contributing to my family life and to my surroundings in general.
