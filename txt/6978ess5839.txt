			 At 60 it would be good to be working slightly less hours to allow time for other interests. I hope to still be running regularly, an continue my coaching work at the athletics club. I expect to be still enjoying live music and getting out frequently. The kids will be in their mid-20s and I hope they have a clear vision of what they want to do with their lives . . . even if they haven't reached those goals yet. It would be great if my wife was working less giving us more time together. Hope to have cleared mortgage by that time.
