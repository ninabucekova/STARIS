			 This is difficult to imagine having recently got divorced, but I would hope to have met someone else by then who appreciated me. I would hopefully have re-established a good and happy relationship with my two children who by now may well have married and be in secure and worthwhile jobs that would give me an opportunity to enjoy Grandchildren. I would play more golf as an activity and way of keeping exercised. By the time I am 60 I will hopefully have reduced my working hours and be enjoying the fruits of my labours such as a reasonable pension income and capital from the business I have helped develop.
