			 I retired at 58, having worked for 40 years at the {WORKPLACE}, {PLACE Wales}. My wife & I have finally moved from the marital home into a 2 bed bungalow. We continue to maintain close relationships with both our daughters - who have since settled down with children of their own. My wife & I take immense pleasure in being with our grandchildren & helping our family group as much as our health can muster, good health permitting, I continue my walking trips with a local rambling group - and have finally encouraged my wife to join!? I set aside 1 day per week for baking bread, cakes, etc..... we make more use of local theatre venues and I have joined an art class (painting). (Seems busier than my working days - maybe I won't retire afterall!?)
