			 THE LIFE I AM LEADING IS LIKE TRYING TO CLIMB UP A MOUTAIN WITHOUT A PEAK, ALL MY LIFE I HAVE WORKED HARD WITH LITTLE FINACIAL REWARD MY FAMILY ARE MY ROCK THEY ARE THE REAL REASON FOR ME TO CARRY ON. WITHOUT THEM I WOULD HAVE NO REASON TO CARRY ON. MY WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN SUPPORT ME IN EVERY WHICH WAY THEY CAN. I HAVE HAD 28 YEARS OF WEDDED BLISS. I KNOW IM NOT GOING TO BE WELL OFF ALL MY SPARE MONIES HAVE BEEN INJECTED INTO THE FAMILY AND MY HOME WHICH I HAVE NEARLY BOUGHT.
