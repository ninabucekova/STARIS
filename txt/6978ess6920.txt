			 I expect that I will be just about to retire, or thinking about doing so. I will be looking for volunteering opportunities in fields that interest me - youth offending, criminal justice, local community issues. I'll be spending time with my family - my husband, son, mums & siblings & their families. I will have time for leisure interests such as walking, holidays, gardening. I will be more relaxed, I hope I will still be healthy. I will be able to travel more. I'll have fewer money worries, my son will be settled in his career. I will be able to make more choices about what I want to do with my time.
