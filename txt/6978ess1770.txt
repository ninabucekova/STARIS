			 By 60 I hope to be retired, spending a lot of time travelling & living in our Farmhouse in Spain. If my children are still in England I will frequently visit or they will be with me in Spain. I will still be going to the gym, learning Spanish & I hope to be fit & healthy. Whilst hoping to be retired I hope to spend more time with my friends & remain very active.
