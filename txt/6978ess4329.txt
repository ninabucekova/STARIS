			 I plan to enjoy a more rounded life in terms of sport & social activity combined with work to achieve balance. As my children will be ready to leave or have left home I would like to plan a more self indulgent life with my wife to travel and work in the community. It is important that the environment is looked after and charity work in that corrective is something both my partner and I would find fulfilling. I also plan to stay healthy to enjoy the many activities we will plan and to be there for my girls.
