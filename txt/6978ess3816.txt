			 I am now 60 and work part time, both my children are grown up and self sufficient. I am working to retire shortly in Florida, the cold weather does my health no favours. I am intending to spend the next few years, travelling, as my mortgage is now paid off and I have sufficient income from my private pensions to enable me to choose what I want to do.
