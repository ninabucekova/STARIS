			 Having paid my mortgage off at the age of 50 and receiving a pension, I would like to be in part time employment such as garden maintenance. Being part time would allow me to play golf at least once a fortnight. Maybe, my children may have left the nest by then, in which case we may think about down sizing and moving nearer the coast. As for my health, having taken on retired greyhounds, which I currently support in re-homing and would like to continue into my 60's means that I do daily walks. I would continue to watch my diet habits, but in the main, slow down a bit and take on board that my body is no longer in its 20's.
