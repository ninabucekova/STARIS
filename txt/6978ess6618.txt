			 I will be happily co-habiting and living a semi-country life but within commutable distance to the city centre for Theatre/cinema etc. I will be writing short stories & be moderately successful. I will have 2 oriental cats, a dog (not sure what) & maybe care of a donkey. I will be fit & strong & emotional secure & will continue to enjoy the outdoor life walking, gardening. I might even be self employed & in some capacity - maybe counselling. I will be financially secure & enjoy European holidays/city breaks. Who knows I might even fulfill my dream of a holiday home in Cornwall. Here's hoping & health permitting.
