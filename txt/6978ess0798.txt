			 I will be living in a smaller, older house - maybe a cottage - maybe in the country. I will still have an interest in my (ex) job - still be in contact - may even still be at work. I will be a Grandmother - and enjoy this role I will spend a lot of time with friends and family - and have a cat! Still cooking. Still struggle with weight. Have trouble with joints! I would like to think that I will have a new partner in my life and be happy.
