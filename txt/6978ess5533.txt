			 I will be living in the same house that I live in now. I will either be retired or working part time (around 15-20 hrs per week) for myself from home. Probably selling on Ebay. I will not receive a state pension until the age of 63, but I will have enough savings to cover me until I receive a pension. I hope to be in good health. My husband will be retired and we will have 2-3 holidays per year and weekends away. We may take a longer winter holiday abroad for a month or longer. My hobbies will be digital photography and spending more time in the garden. I will have one or two Grandchildren to take out and look after.
