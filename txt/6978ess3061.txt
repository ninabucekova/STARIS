			 I have finally retired from work, although I do keep in touch with my ex-colleagues & see them socially. Now, my husband and I are able to travel more and he is able to pursue his Golf. I have plenty of time to make & decorate my speciality cakes now and even make a small profit. I am catching up with all those books I've been hoarding. We have moved to a more modest house which needs less maintenance and has a safe garden for the grandchildren and all those cats!
