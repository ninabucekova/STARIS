			 At 60 I hope that I will have retired from paid employment, perhaps still helping in school as a voluntary reader etc. This will enable me to travel and partake in activities at any time of year. I hope to be happy, and that my children, will be well on their way to being independant. Hopefully my health will be good too. I suppose I hope to have lost a few stones too! I wish that my husbands health will be ok. too so we can enjoy a long and happy retirement together.
