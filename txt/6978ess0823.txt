			 I hope to still have lots of energy and enthusiasm to do the things I want to do at 60. Our children will feature greatly in our lives and seeing them and sharing time with them would be important. I try to be sensible about diet and fitness to a degree so at 60 I would like to maintain that. Travelling would feature highly in my life. Maybe more hobbies such as photography or painting also tennis walking, swimming. Work would be reasonably important as I should have more time with the children being self-sufficient. Maybe some voluntary work. Need more room!
