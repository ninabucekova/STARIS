			 I am still sound of mind and body and therefore able to continue my leisure persuite of walking, gardening, racing and theatre. I enjoy meeting friends for a catch up and a drink although I drink a little too much. I miss work but try to get more involved on a voluntary basis than I had time for before. I have no money worries.
