			 I plan to retire at 60 years of age. My mortgage was payed eight years previously. My children have grown-up and left home. I have downsized my house to one half its size and invested the monies. I spend my time on the golf course, gardening and watching football (with a real ale or a good wine). I also plan another cruise in between visiting friends and relations abroad. I am glad I have lived this long! Its been a good life so far, despite occasional setbacks.
