			 I DONT REALLY KNOW, WHO DOES KNOW WHAT LIFE HOLDS FOR ME. STILL HAPPILY MARRIED, LOOKING AFTER MY GRANDCHILDREN FOR THEIR MUM'S TO WORK. STILL DOING MY LITTLE CLEANING JOBS THAT I HAVE. ALWAYS GOING ON OUR ANNUAL FAMILY HOLIDAY WITH MUM & DAD@ AND ALL OUR GIRLS & THEIR PARTNERS & CHILDREN. THIS IS MY WORLD MY FAMILY. THERE IS NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT TO ME & HOPING WE ARE ALL FIT & WELL.
