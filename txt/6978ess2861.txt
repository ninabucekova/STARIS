			 At age sixty I hope to be retired - participating in some voluntary work. Being more involved with family, friends and my local neighbourhood. I would like to think my health would allow me to remain active, continue attending the gym 3 times a week. Singing in the choir, having singing lessons, piano lessons and attending various courses at the local college. Would like to do some cookery courses. Photograph, painting, learn to read music and as well as choir, join another musical society putting on Broadway productions. In between all this keeping home having a fulfilling relationship with my husband and ejnoying quality time together with fires & family, more time to relax and enjoy the moment instead of rushing around fitting everything in around a full time job.
