			 I expect to be playing tennis and some golf, walking and watching my children play sport. I will still be working - I own my company and - credit crunch apart - hope to do so for the next 15 years! I enjoy shooting and if that gets too expensive I particularly enjoy beating and picking up for the other gun with my gun dog. (You get paid!) I hope to be fit and active and able to work on my house and garden and visit children with my wife. I would like to visit theatre and cinema and live sports events and will probably join the Royal British Legion and Rotary as my business life slows down. PERSONAL
