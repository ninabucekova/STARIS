I am now on incapacity & find it hard financially I want to work but as a result of not drinking & being sacked for an illness I have lost a lot of confidence people are usually sacked for sexual or fraudulent offences I feel ashamed to go into my town where I work. I cant go alone. This limits my capacity to do what I want also the UNCLEAR of my car.
