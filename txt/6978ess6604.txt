			 I am retired but do the same voluntary work each week. I regularly go to concerts with my husband. I still swim 3 times a week to remain fit & healthy. Both my daughters have left home and have families of their own who we see regularly. I enjoy country walks on fine days, the cinema on wet days and love reading.
