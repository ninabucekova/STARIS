			 I continue to work on a part-time basis in a school. This gives me several dimensions to my life. Firstly, the social aspect of working environment, secondly the feeling of usefulness any job gives and finally, supplements the small private pension I have so that I can continue to enjoy a reasonable standard of living. As I have got older, I have found time to spend on myself, doing activities I want to do to keep me fit and active, I've lost some weight and have more energy (something that I was determined to do when I was fifty) and am enjoying life to the full. Time goes so quickly. I enjoy spending time with our grandchildren but worry about what the future holds for them. On the whole, I am content with my life. Scenario Two- we've sold up and moved to a warm country and having a great time learning a new language & culture!
