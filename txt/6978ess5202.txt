			 I will just have retired from the company I work for now. The mortgage is not yet paid off and my pension from work is not adequate to maintain our lifestyle so I have started a new lower paid job, either part time or in a different field. My wife is still working part time too. The children have left home and are working away, our health is about the same as now. We are socially active, seeing friends and family regularly. We still ski and play golf and are social members of the rugby club. We take a holiday plus 2 or 3 short trips a year, fulfilling some of our life ambitions, whilst planning for retirement at 65.
