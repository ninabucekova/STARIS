			 Ive retired as a nurse at fifty five but work partime as a triage nurse for out of hours. I still spend lots of time in the garden with {HUSBAND}. We live comfortably but have to watch the pennies. I still enjoy crafting. My health is reasonable and we still travel. Our children from both our previous marriages visit frequently. We may even have grandchildren on the scene.
