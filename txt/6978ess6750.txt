Our outgoings have greatly been reduced and I have time on my hands to get back to writing. At least my job has stayed secure so I've still a reasonable income. Still got the odd blood pressure problem but now I'm being seen about my urinary system (hope its not prostate cancer) {WIFE} still drives me spare but I've long learnt to accept the situation. She won't change and nor will I. At least without the additional stress of {SON} we can be UNCLEAR to each other. Oh and these UNCLEAR are UNCLEAR - much easier than a keyboard and mouse and they keep a good check on my general wellbeing,
