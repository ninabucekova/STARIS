			 My life now would be quieter as all my children would have left home and be in work and enjoying their children and marriages or parterships. I would only be able to see my grandchildren at weekends and would look forward to this as phone calls during the week would only break the quietness in my life. Because of Health problems it would be taking me longer to do any household chores and visiting friends, and family. I would not let on to my children how my health was affecting me as I would not like them to worry. Money would still be short but hopefully manageable My dogs would keep me company, and make me feel loved, and My garden would be my only interest other than reading.
