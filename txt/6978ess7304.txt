			 I am still going out socialising - playing darts & dominos for my local ladies team, and going to bingo. I have retired form work and spending more time with my husband. My daughter is settled in a relationship with children of her own. I do not have a healthy bank balance as these past few years I have had to care for my husband due to his ill health and have had to survive on benefits. This is taking a toll on my health and I feel very stressed out. I help out and attend a 'over 60's' club one afternoon each week, and go on day outings with them.
