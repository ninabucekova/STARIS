			 60 Years young. I hope to still have good health at 60, which will allow me to enjoy the activities that give me most pleasure. Hopefully, by that time looking after some grandchildren with my wife, and playing golf & still holding a decent handicap. Pavedigim should still be a major part of my life, & that includes the social aspects. Retirement may be within reading distance & with a fit mind & body I hope to make the most of it.
