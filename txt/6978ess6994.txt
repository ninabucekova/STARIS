			 I am now retired from installation work and work for my son when he has too much work for himself. My wife {WIFE}, and I travel more now and spend as much time as we can in Canada and the U.S.A. We have made friends there over the past few years and enjoy visiting them, mostly in the ice hockey season. The family also jointly own a nice villa in Portugal and spend some really nice holidays there mostly at different times but occasionally as a whole family. My health is quite good, have to keep an eye on my blood pressure and I still have problems with my knees but I still manage to do most of the things I wish to do.
