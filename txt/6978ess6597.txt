			 At 60 I will probably still be working in a similar job to the one I am in. Working a full day and a full week. My wife and I will be visiting our children when we can and we may be grandparents, we will have had the opportunity to travel abit more. Healthwise I will still struggle with my weight but hope to be fit - if I take care of myself now. we will be thinking more about where to live in retirement. Both sets of parents will have died. I will be actively engaged in alsorts of activities through work and leisure time. I hope to be still cycling and will probably do abit more gardening. I might even enjoy it!
