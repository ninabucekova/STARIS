			 ME AT 60 As someone with many years experience in my area of work I now spend much of my employment time advising and supporting others to develop new projects. I work now only three days per week spending the remainder of my time on my own writing and photography. My children are now of an age where they look after themselves so the time we spend together is now more about sharing interests - not me "looking after" them. General health is good, with the occasional ache and pain for a life time of wear and tear. Mostly life is good!
