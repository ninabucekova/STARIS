			 I fear that at 60, I will find myself widowed and having to face life alone, coping with trying to maintain the house and having to work longer hours to support myself. The life I would like to have at 60 is similar to the life I lead now - a part-time job, several holidays away in a motorhome and occasional meal out. At 60, I shall no longer have the responsibility for my aging mother but will probably be required to babysit the grandchildren. Failing eyesight makes it even harder to keep up my main interest-playing the piano, but don't rule out the fulfillment of a dream - to have drum lessons, I expect to continue to meet up with with my school friends as I have done for the last 40 years and to enjoy their company.
