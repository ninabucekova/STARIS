			 I would like to imagine that when I am 60 years old I will still be participating in my interests of geneology (family tree) & latest developments in technology. I will still be happily married to my wife {WIFE} and look forward to the times I spend with my grandchildren. My health is still as good as it was when I was 50 and I am not plagued to often by occassional lower back pains. I will be comfortably well off and looking forward to retirement in the next few years providing I can afford it. I expect to still be working hard in the Telecommunications/Computer Networking area.
