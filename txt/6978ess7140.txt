			 I am retired from work, looking after my husband and enjoying myself, going out shopping and for meals with my husband. We also have a caravan which we both love touring about in it to different places and meeting different people. We take our dog {DOG} with us. And also my grandchildren sometimes, but only 2 at a time, as having all four together in the caravan stresses me. So I will love haveing them over. I love reading magazines and watching telly.
