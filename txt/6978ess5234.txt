			 I WOULD LIKE TO IMAGINE THAT I WOULD BE IN GOOD HEALTH AND SO WOULD MY FAMILY. I HAVE MANY INTERESTS THAT I PURSUE AND I WOULD LIKE TO THINK I AM STILL ABLE TO DO SO, iE, WALKING, GARDENING, FIELDWALKING PAINTING ETC. I HOPE MY HUSBAND MAY HAVE SLOWED DOWN A LITTLE AT WORK AND THAT WE MAY SPEND THE ODD DAY OUT TOGETHER EXPLORING TOWNS & COUNTRYSIDE. I SHOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT AT 60 I DID NOT HAVE TO WORK BUT SHOULD THE NEED BE THERE I WOULD. I SHOULD LIKE TO THINK MY CHILDREN HAD FINALLY SETTLED IN THEIR OWN HOMES BY THEN, BUT GENERALLY JUST HAVING TIME TO RELAX MORE WITH MY HUSBAND.
