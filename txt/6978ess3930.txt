			 I am still working pretty much full time but I have paid off my mortgage. I still have elderly relatives to take care of. I have less energy than I had. I hope to have time to persue evening classes now as I am interested in art and crafts. I am still busy with helping to run church activities, but hopefuly I wont have to rush about as much.
