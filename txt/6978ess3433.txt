			 At age 60 I am still married to my husband {HUSBAND}. We have lived in our present house for 20 years now & are happy here, along with our 2 cats. I work part-time, even though I don't need to, but I enjoy my job & meeting new people. I like to cook meals for friends, & sewing is a pleasure. I try to spend more time in the garden, & started growing vegetables a few years ago in the limited space available. My husband & I are fit & healthy & enjoy travelling abroad & visiting new places. We have at least one good holiday a year. We also enjoy getting out & about, visiting friends & places, especially when the weather is good.
