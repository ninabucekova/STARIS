			 I am doing a job that is very rewarding. Working with people Planning and looking forward to my Retirement. Spending time with my grandchildren (hopefully I will have some one day) I have accomplished my own group of people - getting together x 1 every 2 weeks to do crafts / learning and teaching new skills.
