			 I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT BY THE TIME I WAS 60 I WOULD BE EITHER RETIRED OR AT LEAST SEMI-RETIRED BUT WHETHER THIS IS REALISTIC IN THE PRESENT ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND ITS EFFECT UPON MY PENSION IS UNKNOWN. I HOPE THAT AT LEAST MY WIFE WOULD HAVE RETIRED BY THEN AND THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO ENJOY MORE LEISURE TIME. IF MY ASPIRATIONS ARE FULFILLED I WOULD ANTICIPATE RETIRING TO SCOTLAND AND BE ABLE TO SPEND TIME INDULGING MY HOBBIE, OF TRAVEL, PHOTOGRAPHY AND HISTORY. I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT I WOULD BE IN GOOD HEALTH AND ABLE TO TRAVEL EXTENSIVELY, PARTICULARLY IN ITALY AND WOULD BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN LOCAL CLUBS AND ASSOCIATIONS, POSSIBLY UNDERTAKING SOME VOLUNTARY WORK, FURTHERING MY EDUCATION WITH A FURTHER (OPEN UNIVERSITY) DEGREE OR LANGUAGE STUDIES. I WOULD LIKE TO SPEND MORE TIME IN THE GARDEN. THE REALITY, HOWEVER, WILL PROBABLY BE THAT I WILL BE CONTINUING IN FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT (POSSIBLY NOT IN THE SAME PROFESSION) AND THAT MY LIFESTYLE WILL NOT BE MUCH DIFFERENT FROM TODAY. TIME WILL TELL!
