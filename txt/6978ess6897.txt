			 I hope in ten years time to be retired on a good NHS pension. I hope to have more grandchildren. I hope to be in a smaller house, but still big enough for all my family to visit. I hope they have a better knowledge of my illness and be pain free. I would like to do voluntary work helping in a hospital.
