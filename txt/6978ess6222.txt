			 Hopefully by the time I'm 60 my son will be finished university and have a job. I will be working part-time maybe less. I will be spending a lot of my time overseas - mainly on my farm in Morocco. I will be in good health generally living in a healthier environment. I'll be running my own business and perhaps teaching English myself if I need to. I will be feeling very happy to have once again escaped Britain with all its taxes - not to mention the weather.
