			 I hope to be retired and living in France I hope to be very fit and healthy and leads- a full, varied and interesting life I am to read a great deal, travel extensively and be fluent in French. I will not rely on my neighbours speaking English. My husband & I will not have a great deal of money to live on but will get by on money we have saved over the years and due to being self sufficient (e.g. growing fruit & veg in abundance!) and through keeping chickens. The good life!! We will afford travel and holidays due to having our own caravan & through having a small gite available for rent for several weeks of the year. I will take an OU course in History. I will cycle, run & play golf with my husband, I look forward very much to becoming a grandparent I will stay in touch & look after many family members & friends when they visit France.
