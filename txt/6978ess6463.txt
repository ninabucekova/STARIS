			 I am working less than I was at age 50 I spend time with my family and 3 sons (the 2 youngest of which are pursuing university courses). I spend time with my wife & enjoy weekend sightseeing trips, country walks with my dog and meals out. I enjoy reading and watching movies. I also spend more time doing DIY tasks that I had less time for in my 50's!
