			 I will be self employed & working the farm although my son will be doing more of the day to day organising. My hobby will still be watching Rugby Union & following the team, attending all home matches & some away. Eating out in nice restaurants with friends will be happening several times a year. My partial knee replacement & lung problems are still OK and not affecting my life too much, but my eyesight has probably deteriorated more for, reading and close work. I now am used to having to keep my glasses with me so that is not such a problem.
