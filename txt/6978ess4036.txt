			 I imagine that I will be owning & running a bed & breakfast in the south of England (going back to my home area after living away for 10 years). Still working as a way to earn money for mortgage and living. This would enable me to have contact with people, but allow me to 'work from home' and have time to pursue hobbies such as gardening, cooking & crafts. My health is generally good, although I may feel body parts being to wear! I spend quality time with the grandchildren & have more time with sons & extended family & friends.
