			 I AM LIVING IN FRANCE . . . OR IS IT ITALY? THE WEATHER IS MUCH WARMER AND SUNNIER THAN NORTH WALES. THIS MAKES ME FEEL MORE CONTENT. MY HEALTH IS STILL VERY GOOD AND I AM MUCH FITTER THAN WAS. I DO MORE EXERCISE WORKING IN THE GARDEN TRYING TO GROW MY OWN PRODUCE SO THAT I AM MORE SELF SUFFICIENT. I AM ALSO WORKING HARD CONVERTING A BARN INTO ANOTHER HOLIDAY LET TO INCREASE MY INCOME. I HAVE A LOVING PARTNER AND TWO DOGS. I CAN SPEAK THE LANGUAGE PRETTY WELL NOW. SORRY HAVE TO GO NOW THE POOL AWAITS!
