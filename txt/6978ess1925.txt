			 I am "winding down" preparing for retirement where I hope I am fit & healthy enough to do the things I have been planning to do. I would get up in  the mornings when I wanted to & would not have a routine to follow. I would have more time to do what I want to do like spending more time with my family, going on holidays & just relaxing My home life I hope would be content. The morgage would be paid, the house would be furnished as I would like ot to be & hopefully all 3 of us are well.
