			 I am in good health and in retirement from my full time job although I am working for 2/3 days a week for financial reasons and to make use of my knowledge and skills. I am enjoying life with my grandchildren and wider family. My husband and I now have time to walk the entire coastal path of England & to make full use of our National Trust Membership. We have enough money for our needs & little extras but have to be careful with expenditure. I have more time to tend the garden and for my church which gives my great pleasure. I am readily available for babysitting and child care which I do for my own enjoyment but also to support my children. I have a fulfilling and happy life.
