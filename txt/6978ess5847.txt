			 I am looking forward to my retirement when I intend to do a lot more international travel. My weekends are spent either watching and supporting Stoke City Fc. or teaching new students how to scuba dive and enjoying the moment in their eyes when they first breath underwater. I will still be working as a Health & Safety Manager but hoping to go part time to give me more time around the house and with my wife and grandchildren. My health is not to bad my sciatica still gives me pain. I do a lot of cycling and I scuba dive for pleasure at least once every 2 weeks.
