			 If health and prosperity carry on I aim to retire at 55-57 my interests are sailing and travelling. All being well my wife and I are going to sail the Greek Islands at a leisurely pace over about a 5 year period, or as long as it takes before we get fed up . I dont know if at 60 we will be active enough to still go skiing but hopefully that also will be at the top of my list.
