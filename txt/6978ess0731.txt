			 Although I am 50 years old, due to ill health I have not worked for several years, the last Consultant I saw compared my fitness to that of a 70 year old. These days I get short of breath easily. I have no stamina and I am tired all the time. I dread to think what I will be Capable of in ten years, I hope that I can still do what I do now. Spend some time on my Pe, spend a few hours in The pub once or twice a week, have The odd day out with my wife and attend my tai Chi clan once a week.
