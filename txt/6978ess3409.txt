			 I've now fully built up my 2 business's, and I'am now ready to retire or take a back seat, and hopefully enjoy what I have worked for. My wife and I will try to set up our children financially, and enjoy our grandchildren's development. I will still follow my interests in football and speedway, and will still attend live matches & meetings on a regular basis.
