			 I am 60 now & still working, there is no chance I can retire anytime soon I still go walking at the weekends & we take the grandchildren with us when ever they are down. I still do quite a bit of reading but its nice when we babysit for the children. My health is pretty good apart from shoulder which plays me up from time to time and also a few aches in some of my other joints. Still go out from time to time with our friends, its nice to have a drink & a chat.
