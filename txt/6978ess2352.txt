			 My life would not have changed that much in 10 years. I will probably still be at work. My husband will still be working. My son may have left home (25yrs) so there would be more time to spend with my husband. Hopefully my health and well-being will remain as they are now, pretty good. One of my hobbies I share with my son, so it would depend if he still lived at home or close by.
