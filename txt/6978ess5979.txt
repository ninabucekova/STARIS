			 I will still be working and will have a couple of children still in full time education. I expect to be living in London but also to have a home elsewhere. In addition to work, I will continue to have an interest in arts organisations and the media. As well as the children still at school, I will have three children in their 20s and I would imagine that they will also be in London.
