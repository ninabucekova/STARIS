			 I am now retired after working 25 years in the same job and living in Spain, my children now responsible for themselves and the aches and pains of normal life have gone, living in a warmer climate makes me feel good and life is not ruled by time, doing a variety of jobs, bit here, bit there and many more friends that you feel care, more time to build up a family community, hopefully health will be good as I deffinately feel more like walking and gardening and time to eat a better diet not worrying about money, enough to get by on and living every day as it comes.
