				 National Child Development Study: Sweep 8, 2008-2009 
		 
			 I spend a good deal of my time in "creative" pursuits: painting (an exhibition or two?) Sculpting, writing, (a book in the making?) I have more time for myself, one daughter still based at home, (at University/art school?) {HUSBAND} still working but less in London, Grandchildren have started to feature but I've done lots of childcare in my life and the occasional work/painting day/overnight keeps me in touch with them. I have done further studies in counselling/mentoring and use these to earn a bit but also engage in a wider world. Health good except for continuing knee/lower back UNCLEAR but keeps me concentrating on fitness. I swim, bicycle, (holidays are walking, cycling, some skiing), pilates. Birdwatching & gardening still take lots of time. See friends from further away more again now, family are adults, voluntary work increased.
