			 I have recently retired having sold my business last year. I am continuing to spend a lot of time waching athletics but fortunately can now spend more time on my other leisure interests which have had to take a back seat in recent years. Hill walking, orienteering, ski-ing and mountain biking are all pursuits I am once again enjoying.
