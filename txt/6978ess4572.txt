			 I'm 60 years old and still living here. Been married for 5 years. Still working within the NHS but as an auxillary nurse. My health is good and have nothing to worry about apart from the usual minor ailments. I still like doing crosswords. Sudukos, wateting to and occasionaly going out hill walking. Eating out and looking after my grandchildren I'm very happy with my life.
