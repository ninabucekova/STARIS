			 In ten years time I would hope to have taken early retirement and be in a position to enjoy the fruits of my investments. I see some volunteer work maybe twice a week on the local heritage steam railway, and still being with my current partner also being able to indulge our passion for walking and travel. Hopefully I will still be fit enough to still be playing tuba in a local brass band as well as some jazz, maybe I could use some of my extra time too in an organisational role!
