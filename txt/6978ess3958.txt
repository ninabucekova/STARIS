			 I am living in a smaller property further outside Reading. I am just about to retire from my job with a government agency but looking for a part time job locally. I am still with the Scout Association but perhaps in a more supportive role rather than as an active section leader. I still enjoy going to see my football team, and also going to the theatre to see shows and plays. I will have some grandchildren and would like to take these on camping holidays.
