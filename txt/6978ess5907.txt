			 Going out to clean a few windows this morning. I have got rid of all the difficult ones and kept the easy ones. At the weakend we are taking the grankids camping. While were are away my two sons are going to paint the outside of the house. Its good to see we are still a close family. I am suprised to see I am still very active and able to work at 60. Nothing much has changed. {WIFE} and I are looking foreward to celabrating our 39th wedding anniversary. All the family will be here.
