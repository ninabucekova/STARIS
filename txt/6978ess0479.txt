			 My wife and I both still dance although I have stopped competing - our son is now married and has a child - he is posted in the Gulf at the moment. We go on holiday twice a year. Our debts are nearly paid off. I am still in full time work (probably at same place) and feel that I need to be here until I'm 70 to be able to pay for my retirement. I'm thinner now than in 2008 but my legs aren't as strong and I wear glasses all the time now.
