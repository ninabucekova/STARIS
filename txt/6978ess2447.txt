			 I am now 60 for the last 15 years I have been with {PARTNER} we have not married and never felt it necessary as he makes feel loved and secure. I have never been so happy in a relationship. I teach at a local college which I enjoy. I have a full social life I go to salsa classes with {PARTNER} and other friends. With these same friends we eat out go to the theatre and enjoy holidays together, I also enjoy holiday with just Rob and myself. I am very proud of my two sons they have good jobs and lovely homes and hopefully I would have grandchildren by now.
