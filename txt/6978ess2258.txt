			 AT 60 I HOPE THAT MY ARCHITECTS BUSINESS IS STILL GOING WELL ENOUGH TO PROVIDE MY LIVING BUT I WOULD HOPE TO BE SLOWING DOWN A BIT. I EXPECT OUR DEVELOPMENT COMPANY TO GROW TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN ANTICIPATE RETIREMENT IN A FEW YEARS TIME. BY NOW WE SHOULD BE LOOKING TO BUY OUR RETIREMENT HOME IN SPAIN & TO BUY A NEWER YACHT IN READINESS FOR OUR RETIREMENT. WE WILL DOWN SIZE OUR HOME TO PAY OFF OUR MORTGAGE AND RETAIN A SMALLER HOME IN THE UK. I EXPECT MY HELATH TO IMPROVE NOW THAT MY KNEE OP. IS COMPLETE BUT WOULD NOT RULE OUT FURTHER PROBLEMS HERE.
