			 I AM STILL LIVING WITH AND IN LOVE WITH MY WIFE. WE STILL MAKE EACH OTHER LAUGH. WE ARE BOTH STILL HEALTHY AND ACTIVE ABLE TO GET AROUND ON OUR OWN. OUR CHILDREN ARE BOTH SUCCESSFUL AND ARE HAPPY IN THE LIFE CHOICES THEY HAVE MADE. WHEREVER IN THE WORLD THEY ARE THEY ARE STILL IN REGULAR CONTACT AND WE ALL GET TOGETHER REGULARLY. THEY BOTH KNOW THAT THEY CAN COME TO BOTH MY WIFE AND MYSELF FOR ANYTHING AND WE WILL BE THERE FOR THEM! THEY KNOW THEY'RE LOVED! WE ARE ALL ONE EXTENDED FAMILY AND WE GET ON AND LOVE THEIR WIFE/PARTNERS AND CHILDREN. I AM STILL WORKING AND ENJOY WHAT I DO, I HAVE PAID OFF MY MORTGAGE AND AM IN A POSITION TO RETIRE WITHOUT ANY MONEY CONCERNS. MY PENSION IS SAFE AND PROVIDES US WITH ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN A GOOD STANDARD OF LIVING WITHOUT HAVING TO SCRIMP AND SAVE. WE DO NOT WORRY ABOUT HEATING/FOOD BILLS, AND ARE ABLE TO AFFORD HOLIDAYS/TRAVEL WHEN WE WISH. THE WORLD IS AN OVERALL BETTER PLACE. MY WIFE ONLY WORKS THE HOURS SHE WANTS. WE BOTH ENJOY SOME OF THE SAME HOBBIES AND WE ARE LUCKY THAT WE STILL HAVE A GROUP OF CLOSE FRIENDS WHO WE SHARE SPECIAL TIMES/HOLIDAYS ON A REGULAR BASIS. LIFE IS GOOD AND LOOKING BACK I WILL HAVE MANY MORE JOYS THAT SORROWS.
