			 Still having to work as no pension to fall back on. My 2 girls are now 26 & 22 years old and therefore I hope I will be still very much of their lives. Hopefully I will still be healthy & active as I enter my sixties and enjoying good holidays and past times. Hopefully will be still interested in my sporting activities. although as now older maybe more of a spectator. Whether I will still be with my current partner I don't know - if not I will be single as if I can't make a long & meaningful relationship with her then I will definitely remain single for the rest of my life
