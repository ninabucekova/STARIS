			 At 60 I am still working full time but for the benefit of me & my husband, Ian - Our children have now left school & university & have settled into their new lives. Our money, our time, is now for us, no longer helping them (just as our parents helped us). We have more leisure time to spend together on the house, garden, holidays but at the same time can welcome the children back home (probably with partners & families of their own). I am able to keep myself fit & healthy, maybe doing more fitness activities, but still involved in village life here in {PLACE Northern England}. Hopefully my wider family - parents, brothers, sisters etc are still well.
