			 Hopefully I will be looking out from my French village house waiting for my partner to return from collecting our fresh morning bread - whilst we await the arrival of our daughter, her partner and our grandchildren to arrive for their quarterly visit. Our garden will be coming into its full productive period with our fruit and veg providing lots of our edible goodies. We will be looking forward to another warm evening and will join our french friends for a quick game of early evening petangue before a family BBQ.
