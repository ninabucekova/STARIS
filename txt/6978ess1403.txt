			 BECAUSE I WAS BORN IN 1958 I COULD NOT RETIRE AT 60 AND HAVE TO WAIT TILL I AM 65 TO DRAW THE STATE PENSION, SO I AM STILL WORKING SOMETIMES I AM PLEASED TO STILL BE IN WORK FEELING USEFUL AND SOMETIMES I RESENT NOT BEEING ABLE TO RETIRE NOW ACHES AND PAINS ARE MORE NOTICEABLE BUT I TRY AND IGNORE THEM! I BECAME A GRANMAR WHEN I WAS 44 SO MY GRANDCHILDREN ARE GROWING UP NOW AND DONT NEED BABYSITTING ANYMORE. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOMETIME FOR MYSELF AT LAST AND MAYBE DO A DEGREE IN SOCIOLOGY SOMETHING I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO. I WOULD HAVE A DOG WHICH MY HUSBAND AND I WILL TAKE FOR LONG WALKS. HE WILL HAVE RETIRED NOW. I WILL BE THINKING OF MOVING BACK TO THE SEASIDE WHERE I AM FROM AND PROBABLY WONT SETTLE UNTIL I ACHIEVE THAT HOPE HUBBY AGREES! (HE DOES NO I WANT TO!) MY CHILDREN WILL BE 38 AND 36 AND I HOPE WILL HAVE SORTED THEIR LIVES OUT BY NOW FINGERS CROSSED!
