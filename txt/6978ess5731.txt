			 I feel keen and eager to work but find I have more aches and pains than I used to. I get tired much quicker, and tend to nod off in the evenings when relaxing. I feel I would like to take life a little easier. I feel I am losing interest in my business and although fit and active I begin to look forward to taking a far more relaxed way of life and pursue some of the things I feel I have missed out on because of a heavy work schedule due to business comittments, and spend more time with my wife and family.
