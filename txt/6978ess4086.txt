			 By the age of 60 I hope to be retired with enough money behind me to lead a comfortable, but not extravagent life. I relish the opportunity to afford the time to play golf on a weekly basis & to maintain a garden of which I can be proud. I would hope to be able to afford at least two overseas holidays a year & to see more of the world. I also hope to enjoy frequent weekend breaks within the UK with friends & family exploring new areas, and walking as much as possible.
