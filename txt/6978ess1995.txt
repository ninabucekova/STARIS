			 MY health will deteriorate as I suffer from Leukaemia and there is currently no cure. I inted to take up the offer of treatment regularly and enjoy life to the full during periods of remission. I expect to spend time travelling and enjoying a warm climate. I anticipate remaining emotionally close to my 2 children but I don't expect they will settle nearby. I think they will pursue careers in London or overseas. I hope to remain happily married and in close contact with friends and family. I would consider doing voluntary work with young or adult offenders to follow on from my career or possibly consider training as a magistrate if the judicial system has not changed. I think I will remain an optimistic and open person who mixes well. I hope that my health affords me the opportunities I am looking forward to.
