			 I have been retired 5 years now and feel much more relaxed and happy. Have been spending the time between homes and taking more holidays of longer duration to destinations further away than I could during my working life. I exercise regularly and feel healthier for it and enjoy making meals and entertaining. Due to retirement planning I still have a good income though a certain amount of work is required to "Keep an eye" on income/investments. I also do a small amount of voluntary work as and when needed. My circle of friends has increased now that I have the time for them and I see more of my family. Most of the changes in my life are due to the responsibilities/pressure/strees and commitment of my working life being left behind me.
