			 I am very happy with my life as I spend several months a year abroad. I love my home as it is not too big, easy to clean with a manageable garden to look after. I go to the gym 2-3 time a week, go shopping & see friends & family frequently. I share all of this with my husband as we are quite similar and love being together. My health is a bit of a problem but I don't dwell on it because I am quite a positive person.
