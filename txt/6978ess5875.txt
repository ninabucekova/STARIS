			 Scary only ten years away! I don't feel 50 at the moment. My daughter will be finished her education & I hope happily settled in jobs and relationships. I may even be a granny! Myself I shall still be working I think. I enjoy being a nurse, thats what I am. I cannot imagine not working. Home life - maybe with my present partner, maybe not. Both at different stages of the divorce spectrum & different ages. Am living & enjoying the present. My family & friends are very important to me. Health well - hope my joint pain doesn't increase! Interests - don't know as yet - still lots to see + do though!
