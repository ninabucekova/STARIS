				 National Child Development Study: Sweep 8, 2008-2009 
		 
			 My children should be settled in their own homes. We will have sold our house & moved to somewhere smaller - perhaps an apartment. I will probably have retired, but assuming my husband is still working, maybe do some part time or voluntary work. I will still read, watch films, use a computer, visit friends & family. I imagine I may have developed minor arthritic complaints. I hope to be otherwise healthy.
