			 I am living in {PLACE1}, Namibia with my husband and one of our adopted daughters. {HUSBAND} took early retirement a few years ago and we are now with Africa Inland Mission longterm. {HUSBAND} teaches at {PLACE1} High School and also sorts out the IT and I've gone back to {PLACE2} for 3 days a week to work as a volunteer amongst the kids with severe disabilities. {FRIEND} & I also go to help with the Pre-school in Block E for a couple of sessions a week - the little kids are such fun! We still have lots of girls from the hostel over to our flat and sometimes I go over to R.H.S. to sing with the choir. Healthwise I'm doing fairly well - my joints (hips & knees) still trouble me on occasions but generally my arthritis is better in this climate than it was back home in the U.K. I miss my children & grandchildren but enjoy talking to them over Skype & am really looking forward to seeing my eldest son, his wife & three kids when they visit over the Christmas holiday.
