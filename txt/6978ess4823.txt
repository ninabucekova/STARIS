			 I am now retired. I am completely relaxed. I am taking two holidays a year instead of one. I am going on a lot of day trips. I am enjoying walking the coastal paths, watching live football, cricket and horse racing. I am enjoying my grandchildren. I am doing some voluntary work in the local community. Life's great!
