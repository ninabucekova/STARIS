			 When I am 60 years old I will be retiring from {WORKPLACE telecommunications} after 40 years service. I expect to be downsizing the family home and buying a small place in Portugal / Spain and commuting back and forward throughout the years. I will still follow football and will spend more time on my golf and with my wife and extended family. My son {SON} will be 30 by then and hopefully he will be married and we will have some grandchildren to spoil. I wil try to keep fit and hopefully still be running some 10k races
