			 It's not easy to say if I will be around in 10 years time, I take one day at a time. At moment I'm working full time in retail from 11 am to 8 pm I don't have much time for any thing els. I like cooking & watching T.V. gardning when its warm weather. I'm very homeley person, don't mind much being on my own. It's life you have to make best of what you got.
