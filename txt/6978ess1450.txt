			 At 60, I will still have 4 children under the age of 20, 3 of which at least, will be in full-time education (schooling). Life and family routine probably won't be very different from when I am 50! I will still be working to provide for the family and this is likely to continue beyond 60. However this is the choice I made (having chilkdren later in life), and I am pretty happy with it.
