			 I have to decide if I want to retire from my job or keep working. This will be based on the type of work I am doing at the time, where I am in terms of completing the work and if I am still enjoying what I do & the people I work with. Assuming I'm in good health, I shall probably look to retire, or at least cut down full time work so I can make the most of my personal life. I shall probably take some time out to decide what I want to do with my personal life & what my partner wants to do. I shall then devote my time to pleasing myself! Well for at least as long as I can!
