			 I now live in France enjoying their way of life. The children come down and stay with us in the holidays. We have a detached house which we have renovated over the last 10 yrs with a large garden. Our horses are in the farmers field which adjoins our garden. Although not keen gardeners we keep the grass short with a few pots around. I help out at the local school with English and PE and my husband teaches a little carpentry. Come and join us - it's great!!
