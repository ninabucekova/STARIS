			 Our daughters have flown the nest, maybe there are son-in-laws / partners and grandchildren on the scene. Our son is not quite a teenager, but at secondary school. I am probably out working a few more hours / an extra day a week, and possibly in a more responsible post. Simon and I may be out walking or kayaking a little more often. Hopefully my kitchen garden project has taken off and we are able to share produce with family and friends. We are still involved in our parish: music, cleaning, admin, socially. Health of course is the unknown quantity, and all these plans are dependent on us being gifted with reasonably good health.
