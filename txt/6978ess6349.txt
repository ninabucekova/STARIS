			 Still in good health and working full time. Happily married, living in the same house. One son moved out to live with his partner, second son back living with us. Still busy with D.I.Y, now at my son's as well. Not often watching the boys play football now, my wife had finally convinced me to play golf. Trying to make more time for holidays & weekend breaks. Visits to the theatre. Still not enough hours in the day!
