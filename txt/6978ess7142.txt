			 My aspirations were to have given up my job with the same employer since I left school at 16 and to be drawing my pension doing some part time work that actually interests me but with no responsibilities. This would have including paying off the mortgage & spending time travelling with the wife. The changes appear to be lining up to prevent me ever achieving such ambition. The endowment will leave a big hole in the mortgage, having paid into my pension for so long the rules are changing that now require I work for longer & leave with less. However my biggest fears are for my children - can they afford anything like the lifestyle we have experienced. I can see them relying upon us for longer both financially & for practical help and assistance with child minding. My own health has taken a downward step over the past 5 years - Too much weight & blood pressure & of late problems with motorbiking with my knees & hips in particular. My wife has diabetes & her own health issues. At present I am finding it difficult to break what has become a routine around work to find time to address my health problems. In 10 years time unless I take action I will have progressed further down the track reducing any possibility of recovery. For years I have been telling myself that things will eventually get better - I will find the me time to do the things I want to do. When I get to 60 I expect to still be looking.
