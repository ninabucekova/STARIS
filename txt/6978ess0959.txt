			 I HAVE RETIRED EARLY, HAVING WORKED FULL TIME UNTIL I AM 55 AND AFTER TAKING A YEAR OUT TO TRAVEL & SCUBA DIVE IN THE PLACES I PREVIOUSLY HAD'NT DONE. FROM 56 TO 60 I WORKED PART TIME BEFORE TAKING MY PENSION EARLY. I SPEND 7 MONTHS IN THE UK & 5 MONTHS AT MY SECOND HOME IN ARIZONA TO MISS THE ENGLISH WINTERS. I HOPE TO BE HEALTHY ENOUGH TO DIVE IN UNCLEAR & GOLF THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. I DO NOT EXPECT TO STILL BE WORKING FULLTIME, HAVING NOT HAD ANY CHILDREN & WIDOWED IN MY 40'S. I WILL PROBABLY STILL LIVE ALONE BUT HAVE A WIDE CIRCLE OF FRIENDS BOTH HERE AND IN ARIZONA WHEN IN THE UK I WILL SPEND TIME WITH MY NIECES & NEPHEWS & GOD CHILDREN & THEIR FAMILIES QUITE LOOKING FORWARD TO IT ACTUALLY!
