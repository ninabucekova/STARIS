			 I am living with my husband in a comfortable home where we welcome our children & grandchildren regularly. As a couple we still have an active weekly social life with friends, enjoying food & wine. Physically, I'm still well & continue to play netball in one of the less physical positions, and enjoy seeing the countryside on leisurely runs with my much younger friends!! I am still enjoying a few hours nursing a week & continue to do the company accounts. Our success after the recession in 2008 allows us to travel to these few and far uncommercialised destinations. We still have fun!
