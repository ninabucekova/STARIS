			 Hopefully I will have a comfortable home (not necessarily large) and although havent a lot of money I can manage and am fit enough to get out in my garden, visit friends and see my family regularly and be there for them if they need me. I would like to do some voluntary work, perhaps for a charity to meet and help people. If I havent a partner I'm not too bothered but it would be better.
