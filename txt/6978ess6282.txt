			 I am now working part time doing something I enjoy but is worthwhile I have more free time now and spend as much time as I can travelling to other countries. I am a grandparent and help out looking after the children. I am happy to share my money with my children to help make their lives easier. I can spend quality time with my husband now & we can both pursue our own interests independent of each other.
