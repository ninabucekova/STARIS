			 I live with my wife {WIFE} in a smaller house than that which we lived in when I was 50 years old. Our children have left home and have their own careers and families. I still work as a civil engineer. I still ride a bicycle on a regular basis. My general health is good although there are signs of deterioration with my eyesight.
