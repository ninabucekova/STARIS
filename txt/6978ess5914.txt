			 I have been retired form the NHS for 5 years. Still going back to do the odd shift to keep up my registration. I have a little dog to look after & can take him up on the downs for walks. Hopefully I will have grandchildren that we will look after some days. My husband is due to retire soon & looking forward to several foreign holidays a year. Maybe we will have a home in the sunshine. We will have downsized to either a bungalow or flat near the seafront. We shall be in fairly good health.
