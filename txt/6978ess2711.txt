			 I'm trying to keep as active as possible, walking, swimming doing a lot of gardening. I go to evening classes once a week & an afternoon fitness class. We eat out quite often, visit the cinema or go to the theatre or a show fairly regularly. I have a part-time job still & hope to continue this for as long as possible or do voluntary work in my local hospital.
