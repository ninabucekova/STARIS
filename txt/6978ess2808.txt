			 As I write at 60 I hope I can say that I will have been cancer free for 5 years as I have had breast cancer this last year. So I hope I will be very healthy!! My husband will have retired and we will enjoy travelling and spending more time together pursuing our interests. I hope also to still be doing some form of voluntary work and just enjoying life!!
