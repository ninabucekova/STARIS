			 At 60: My children will be 26 and 22, so I hope they may be semi independent. I will be living in a country area away from the suburbs. I will be walking in the country every day & still swimming and doing Pilates. My husband and I will be together and in good health. I will be fully retired. My husband and I will be travelling by ourselves (ie not just family holidays) to places we have wanted to visit bit could not when our children were small. I will still be able to sing soprano in my choir!
