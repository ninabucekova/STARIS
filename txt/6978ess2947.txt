			 Having recently retired things look good at the moment, but who knows what is around the corner. Anyway, I have the time to run anytime I want. The house has been decorated throughout but I'm sure {WIFE} can find things for me to do. We are now able to take those 'city breaks' we promised ourselves years ago. The kids are in stable relationships and I enjoy helping them decorate their new homes (2 of them at least). As I said earlier, I feel good, and so does Tracey. Life looks good.
