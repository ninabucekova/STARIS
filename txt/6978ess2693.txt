			 When I was in my 20's I set up my pension to draw at 50. Needless to say when I reached 50 I felt it far too early to retire. I expect to feel just as fit and healthy at 60 but would like to retire and hopefully be in a position to help my children pay off their student loans & then perhaps go travelling with my husband. With more free time I would like to persue new hobbies and interests.
