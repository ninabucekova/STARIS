			 I am retired with a good income from my pensions. I am content not to need fulfillment from working and have found other outlets for my need for achievment. I do voluntary work. I do lots of gardening to keep me fit. I still play hockey but mainly to see my girl friends. My girl friends have become increasingly valuable. My parents have died and my children have moved away & sometimes I struggle to see my future. The voluntary work makes me feel needed, but some of the other volunteers frrustrate me.
