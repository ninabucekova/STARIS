			 I'm still a magistrate hopefully and doing educational appeals work. My grandson will be 12 yrs old and I may have more grandchildren. I hope my health wont change to much more though I know my discs in neck and back will continue to crumble. I wont have any more strokes. I'll still enjoy reading and listening to music. I'll still be with my partner and we will be happy with each other as we are today. Fingers crossed.
