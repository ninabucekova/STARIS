			 I live alone in a small terraced house in a state of considerable disrepair but I am past caring. I got rid of the TV when it all went digital and I must be one of the few still not on the internet. Working life came to an end as a result of public sector reforms but I put in a few hours at a charity shop for something to do. My aunts are still alive in their 90's and live in a care home about an hours drive away. I see them every month or so and struggle to look after their financial affairs. I have a fair bit of contact with a cousin living locally as we are joint trustees for his severely disabled brother. Unfortunately we have little in common and although he is a good man we don't hit it off. My diabetes, for all the medical advances in recent years gets me down, leaving me feeling tired and lethargic or irritable and anxious. I drive but prefer to walk or use public transport. I read a lot of books, amd addicted to Radio 4 and like to get up to London for art exhibitions, visits to the theatre and simply to "mooch" around. I am resigned to the solitary life although it can get very lonely at times. One of the compensations of age is that I am less worried about what other people think and I hope that this attitude will help me break down the barrriers.
