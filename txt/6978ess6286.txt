			 I will be cutting down on work but still working part-time as a homeopath. I will be starting a vegetable & fruit garden & hopefully building an eco-house. I'll be walking a lot with my partner, as well as doing as much culture (film, art, theatre, opera) as I can afford with my partner. I'll have a dog. My health will be good & I'll continue to enjoy the company of friends & family.
