			 I am a volunteer at my local P.D.S.A. doing the bookshelves, Videos and C.D's. In ten years time I will be into my 14th Year. I belong to a group of service users/ carers at {UNIVERSITY} on the Social Work Degree (BSC+ Masters). I will still be doing interviews, presentation, showcases that involve creativity and fitness for Practice for 1st Year students. I will still have a great love of books and creative things that I make such as cross stitch. Money wise I will not be as well off as my amount of benefit will have dropped. Most of my clothes I will buy at charity shops to that I can keep myelf looking well presented as I do take good care of my appearance. Things wil be harder for me economy wise. My health has never been good and I don't expect it to change when I am in my 60th Year. I have many health problems which I have had since being a youngster. I am a carer for my mum at the moment. My mum is in her mid-seventies. I cannot say whether I will still be her carer.  It depends on whether she is still here & the commitments I have for her. I go up once a week to do things for her.
