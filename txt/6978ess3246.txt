			 At 60 years old I would hope my life resembles how I live today I have health and happiness and enough money for my needs, I love & get on very well with my wife who I have been married to for 30 years, 40 years when I'm 60. I hope to still be doing the same job but would hope to cut down to a 4 day week by the time I'm 60. I already have 5 grandchildren & hope to see them grow up healthy & happy and be able to assist with their education if necessary. I would also like to experience different cultures by continuing to enjoy at least Two holidays per year.
