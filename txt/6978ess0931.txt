			 I would hope that I was in a position to be doing some kind of freelance work in the arena that I have been working in for the last 8 years. I am worried about income although I have a state pension & various personal pensions. The cost of living appears to be going through the roof & the only people who tend to get assistance are those who have never worked or are on very low income. Walking, Riding & hopefully having holidays.
