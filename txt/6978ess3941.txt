			 I would be leading a life pretty much the same as I am now. I would hopefully be more healthy and able to spend time with my family. I would probably have more interests, especially creative ones. I would probably be living abroad as my husband would be semi-retired and I would likely be working part-time, teaching ESOL or creative crafts. I would hope to have a larger circle of friends and be closer to my siblings as we'd all have more time for each other. I don't expect my parents to be alive but my family will have grown due to more grandchildren.
