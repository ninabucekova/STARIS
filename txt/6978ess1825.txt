			 Hope to be thinking of retiring, cannot imagine I will be able to keep up the pace of work that I do at the moment, maybe work on the bank. Will get out walking & cycling more. Skiing locally as well as abroad. Get to the gym each morning and not at 7am. Read more books, try painting/art again, gardening. More time to see family and friends. Would love to think I could travel more depends on finance. Hope that I will be healthy without my general health being good I will not be able to achieve the above.
