			 I am happy with my husband and hopefully enjoying good health most of the time! My daughter will be settled in a career which she loves and we will see her often. I hope we can continue to travel and enjoy other cultures. I will still be raising money for charity, organising events and taking on projects to hopefully make a difference. If I can still work, legislation permitting, I would still hope to be teaching at 60, if only part-time. My friends will remain an important part of my life.
