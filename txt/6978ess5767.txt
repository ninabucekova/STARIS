			 I will stil be an Artist and musician, still married happily, still going to the gym for a blast. I hope to have moved away from urban sprawl London. Hopefully I won't need to work my arse off just to get by perhaps I will be able to have holidays, buy a boat, get my life back eh! I hope my slight but potentially serious health issues don't mess things up. I will still be doing a bit of this and that. Hopefully I will have sorted out some sort of incomefrom the property by now. No doubt I will still be a London Taxi Driver but doing it more part time.
