			 At 60 (if Country is properly Governed!) I will have better health as my medical conditions have been treated instead of ineffectively medicated! This has enabled me to work part-time in the community utilizing qualifications I already have. My husband & I spend our leisure time walking our dogs with our grandchid (ren) and tending our vegetable patch. We have plenty of quality TV to watch as 'reality' programs were consigned to the scrap-heap 9 years ago. Our children all live in quality affordable homes, built by people taken off benefits and given a living wage. They have easy access to services thank to taxes being spent on the service they were meant for. There are good roads being laid across the country by thos who's previous employment includes M.P's of all parties, and financiers who caused a meltdown in the markets. However if the status-quo remains the same, at 60 I'll be dead.
