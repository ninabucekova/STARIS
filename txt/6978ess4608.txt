			 I WOULD STILL BE WORKING. NOT DUE TO RETIRE FOR 5 MORE YEARS. MAYBE HAVE SOME GRANDCHILDREN. HOPEFULLY MY HEALTH WOULD BE EXCELLENT, I WOULD LIKE TO BE A BIT MORE FITTER THAN I AM NOW. PERHAPS WALKING MORE WOULD HELP. WORK IS A DIFFERENT MATTER AS AT THIS TIME A LOT OF PLACES ARE CLOSING. BUT HOPEFULLY I WILL STILL BE WORKING IN A JOB THAT I ENJOY.
