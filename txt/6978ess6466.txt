			 Being a civil servant, I retire at 60. I do voluntary work a few hours per week. I bought a pet dogh (Labrador) when I retired so go walking every day. I am playing badminton, spending more time in my garden and kitchen and, as most of my friends have retired too, visit and stay with them and have them visit and stay with me. I have a sister and brother in law in Suffolk and see them regularly, either here, in Suffolk or on day trips to London.
