			 I expect to still work in 10 years time - I enjoy my work and feel that I make a good contribution to work. My children will soon be financially independent (or perhaps already be independent) I hope I will be able to swim more regularly & go to exercise classes. Our dog which I currently walk daily may well be dead/incapacitated in 10yrs time. Will we get another & carry on walking? We (my husband & I sometimes the girls) enjoy walking/talking in the fresh air & getting exercise. I hope I make use of any spare time to go into London to go to Art Galleries, exhibitions, cinema/theatre/opera/ballet. I expect to be in my book class as I enjoy reading & sharing opinions on books with my group. It will be nice to spend more time with friends over a meal.
