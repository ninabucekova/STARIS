			 I am still working full time, my children are now all earning money and have places of their own. I take care of Mum at nights and part of the wekends, but as my sister shares the caring wih me, I am taking holidays 2 or 3 times a year, as I have more money now that I used to have. I am still married and I'm in reasonably good health.
