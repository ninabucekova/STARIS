			 I imagine myself to be still working as a teacher, probably part-time, although thinking about retirement in the next few years. I would like to still be playing as much sport as I do, health permitting, and without so many commitments to children/parents, travel more. I imagine my children will have left home and will be living not too far away. If my parents are still living, I imagine they will be in some kind of care home, quite local to me. I imagine my husband & I would be thinking about possibly moving house, to downsize, although family circumstances would dictate this.
