			 I would like to be Financially secure. The early death of my husband coupled with a loss of family resources meant that 2 yrs ago I was close to homeless. At 65 I will have to sell the house and survive on any money realised - this is likely to be very little. I expect to maintain good relationships with my 4 children and hopefully we can work something out - as I did with my mother (she lives with me). I think I will be physically healthy and still competent and hope to continue to support my children in their lives (as my mother has done). I will still be a teacher. My work is very important to me. I miss the love and affection and support of a partner but see no reason to develop another relationship, I still feel married though I have been a widow for 5 years now. My mother may well still be alive - she is very strong and her mother lived a long time She will be in her 80's though and probably need significant care. PERSONAL
