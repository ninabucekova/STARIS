			 As a 50 yr old I was fitter than I was at 40. Now I'm 60 I'm pleased to say I'm as fit as I was at 50. I'm still involved with equine friends - they keep me fit & healthy & without them life would be very flat. My grandsons keep me young & keep me up to date with current trends that are important to their generation. I feel proud of my children in all that they have achieved & had to cope with in their lives. Financially, I am not rich but comfortable and now that I'm by myself feel positive that I can now be in charge of my own life - even if it means being a bit lonely from time to time.
