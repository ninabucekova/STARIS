			 I have retired and so has my husband. We both do some volentary work together - maybe something environmental, and I still cook and make tea at the church. We both go to choir every week and I still play the piano, although hopefully I will have passed my grade 8 exam by then! Maybe I even teach piano to children a bit. I still go to my recorder playing group every week, but there is more chatting and coffee drinking and less playing now. We are probably not so good at it anymore. The children have finally all left home and married and bring the grandchildren to see us now and then. Mum will need looking after more if she is still alive. I am still quite healthy apart from a bit if back ache, and am leading quite an interesting life - hopefully lots of travel round the world and trips to the theater. There is a lot to fit in before I get too old to enjoy it. There is a lot to look forward to!
