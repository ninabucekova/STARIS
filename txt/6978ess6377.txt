			 After receiving voluntary redundancy, followed by early retirement 10 years ago my husband & I decided to move from S England to N Scotland, where my mother was from, & where we've spent a lot of time over the years. We have no children, or parents still alive so decided to take the plunge whilst we were still young enough to enjoy ourselves (my husband is 12 years older than me). I'm still finding information to add to my family tree & we've had some good trips away to various parts of Britain, researching at record offices, I can now put together lots of background information about our ancestors, which I have been researching for years. I'm still "hooked" on my Scottish dancing, but unfortunately the knees don't let me do very elegant steps, but we do have some great laughs, & as I puff after a particularly lively dance it must be keeping me fit! My memory has never been good but hope that trying to learn so many dances helps me to keep my brain sharp. Fortunately, as we're in our occupational pensions, & only do the odd bit of voluntary work - like helping the Highland Family History Society with their graveyard transcription project.
