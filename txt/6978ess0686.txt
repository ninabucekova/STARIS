			 I'm now 60 and suffer with a few aches and pains, but am generally still in good health and leading a happy home life. I'm still working at school but have cut down my hours and am now going part-time. I enjoy working out in the garden and spending quality time with my grandchildren and family. I also enjoy taking my dog out for walks in the countryside.
