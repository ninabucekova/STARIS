			 I am still supporting my football club (Sunderland) as I have since a small boy. I am still going to the gym, as I try and look after myself. I am looking forward to my retirement which is going to happen very shortly! We have now moved to a smaller apartment as the house is too big for the 2 of us as both children have moved out (they better had)! I enjoy eating out at nice restaurants. I enjoy visiting new places and will continue to do so. I spend a lot of time abroad at my apartment in spain. I enjoy spending some time with our grandchildren.
