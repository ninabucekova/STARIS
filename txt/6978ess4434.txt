				 National Child Development Study: Sweep 8, 2008-2009 
		 
			 The school children have increasingly lower manners. They are encouraged to speak out, but they do not have the ability to do this appropriately. I now have two dogs, great fun taking them for walks and generally great company. My daughter is now married with a child - she seems so much more mature than I was at her age. I walk with my wife at least twice a week. Things are going well, I feel fit & healthy and enjoying life. I could retire from work, but I am not sure I want to. It's hard work to teach kids, but very rewarding.
