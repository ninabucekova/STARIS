			 I would like to wake up a little earlier than normal, go for a walk after breakfast, if the situation dictated my wife and I could spend a little time with my grandchildren before I go to work for a few hours. When I come home from work it is nice to spend some time with my wife, having a good chat over dinner and watching a little television. I will play golf on certain days and that gives me a chance to catch up with a few of my good friends, I would like to think that I wont have to work to hard and if I do the financial reward will help pay for little luxuries like holidays and weekends away.
