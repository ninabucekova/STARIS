			 My life will be much the same as at 51. That is if my employment continues. Finances will go down slightly for the next few years meaning we can not do all the things we plan, eg holidays, retirement, helping the children. Health will continue to deteriate, with a lot of concern over dementia. Over all I am less hopefull for the time 60-70 than I was when I was looking ahead at 51.
