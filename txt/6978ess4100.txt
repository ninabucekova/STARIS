			 I remember writing an essay aged 11, on how I expected my life to be when I was 21, and, imagined I would work at a teacher. I was wrong then, so could easily be again. At 60, I don't expect to have embarked on retirement, partly because, with 2 children who will be 21 and 24, I will probably be still financially in need and partly because I would be bored if I reduced my working hours. I hope to still be writing, to have moved away from London, to be living in a smaller (less expensive) house, and to enjoy more cultural and other leisure events. I hope to have enjoyed success with my books and to have more time and money for travelling, theatre trips and so on. I hope my children will visit and stay regularly and will be happy in their chosen paths. I would like to remain active (swimming, walking and playing tennis) and hope my back problems are kept at bay. I would like finally to have achieved my dream of living near the sea.
