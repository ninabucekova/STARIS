			 I AM FULLY RETIRED, AM A KEEN GARDENER, CLAY-PIGEON SHOOTER & LIKE TO KEEP FAIRLY FIT BY WALKING/SWIMMING. I REGULARLY HAVE MY GOD-CHILDREN STAY OVER AT WEEKENDS, TO GIVE THEIR PARENTS "ME TIME". I HAVE A HOBBY OF PROMOTING WINES - NATIONALLY. MAINLY VIA INTERNET, AS I NOW HAVE THE TIME TO SPARE. I LIKE TO TRAVEL ACROSS EUROPE & ENJOY ALL NEW EXPERIENCES LINKED TO IT, ie PEOPLE, FOOD & WINE, HISTORY ETC, TOGETHER WITH MY HUSBAND. I MAY HAVE A HOLIDAY FLAT TO BOLT TO SEVERAL TIMES PER YEAR TO ESCAPE THE INCREASINGLY WET CLIMES !
