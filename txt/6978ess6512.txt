			 At 60 I hope to be lucky enough to be retired or maybe working just a few hours a week. I would like to have more free time by then to do some voluntary work with animals. I would like to be fit enough to enjoy my garden, walking and travelling. I look forward to having grandchildren. I have a bit of arthritis in my hands & feet and hope that doesn't progress or that there maybe a cure by then.
