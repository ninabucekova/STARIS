			 I still lead a busy, active life, supporting my husband who is a Minister in the church of England & having my own ministry in the church ! My eldest daughter 26 is married and expecting her first baby and I am looking forward to helping her when it is born. This is helped by the fact that my second daughter helps me run the riding school & does a lot of the physical work which I find hard now because of my arthritis, although I still teach & have overall charge. The dog rescue is well established and financially stable. The experience I have gained over the last ten plus years means it runs more smoothly & we have a good reputation of integrity.
