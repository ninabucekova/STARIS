			 I've eventually met the right person in my life, we are reasonably comfortable off, We have some interests which are the same but each have our own hobbies I'm still working hard and long hours but make the most of my spare time, Still full of energy just slowed down a bit but love to help other less fortunate people. no doubt Ill work till I die under this government.
