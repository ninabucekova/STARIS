			 My husband has just retired and we have moved to a smaller house but still with room for the children and grandchildren to stay. We look after the grandchildren sometimes while our son/daughter is at work. We keep healthy with long walks. gardening, etc. We have several foreign holidays a year. We meet up regularly with other retired friends.
