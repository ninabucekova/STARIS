			 I am still working part time in schools, but doing less dashing round the county. I have a few private music pupils too. I play in a band & we perform gigs about once a month (Trad. Jazz). My husband & myself go away about once every 2 months at least for a weekend. We also try & travel abroad once or twice a year, now that we no longer have all our children at home. I swim regularly, my back have improved & I have joined the local Ramblers Assoc. I take part in our church & the various groups there.
