			 I still work part time. I still drive a car I have a strong loving relationship with my children and grandchildren. We do lots of things together such as camping, playing board games or cards, walks out, days on the beach or in the park. School activities, kids sport and leisure activities we support together I don't find it so easy to use my hands due to arthritis I speak on the phone or meet up with my friends we may go to the theatre or cinema or just a good chat over a cuppa. I'm okay.
