			 If I am able to beat my recently diagnosed cancer - I hope to be happy, still in this loving relationship, looking after my parents and running my lovely home and garden. Pretty much the same as I was doing before the diagnosis. Other than the cancer, I thought I was very fit and healthy! I hope to have some grandchildren and sufficient money to keep my house in good repair, pay all my bills without stress and take the occasional holiday & help out the family if they need it.
