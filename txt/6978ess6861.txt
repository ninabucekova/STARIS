			 WHEN I AM 60 MY HUSBAND WILL BE 62 AND I HOPE THAT WE ARE BOTH STILL IN GOOD ENOUGH HEALTH FOR IT NOT TO IMPACT ON OUR LIVES WHICH SHOULD BE FAIRLY FANCY FREE. I SEE THIS AS OUR TIME TO ENJOY THE FRUITS OF OUR LABOURS WHILE WE ARE YOUNG ENOUGH TO DO SO. I HOPE THAT IF WE HAVE NOT RETIRED ALTOGETHER, WE ARE WORKING A LOT LESS THAN WE DO NOW, BUT STILL WITHIN THE COMPUTER BUSINESS WE HAVE RUN SINCE 1990. IF WE ARE RETIRED WE WOULD STILL KEEP CURRENT WITH TECHNOLOGY AND USE IT HEAVILY, ESPECIALLY COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY AS I FEEL IT HAS A LOT TO OFFER THE OLDER GENERATION. IF THINGS GO AS PLANNED WE SHOULD ENOUGH MONEY TO KEEP A SMALL BASE IN ENGLAND, PROBABLY {PLACE South East England} AS BOTH KIDS LIVE HERE AT THE MOMENT, OR BY THE SEA SOMEWHERE. AS WELL AS HAVING ENOUGH MONEY TO ENJOY TRAVELLING OR STAYING IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. THIS IS A GREAT INTEREST OR OURS. WE EXPECT TO SETTLE IN ENGLAND WHEN OUR HEALTH MAKES TRAVELING DIFFICULT. I EXPECT BY THEN TO HAVE OUR FIRST GRANDCHILDREN, BUT ONLY BY A COUPLE OF YEARS, AS THIS WILL MEAN THAT THE KIDS (WHO LEFT HOME THIS YEAR) HAVE HAD SOME YEARS ON THEIR OWN, TO AMASS SOME BACKING BOTH EMOTIONALLY AND FINANCIALLY, BEFORE BEING TIED DOWN WITH KIDS. I WOULD LOVE TO THINK THAT WE HAVE GOT A LARGE GROUP OF GOOD FRIENDS, BUT IN REALITY I CAN SEE US BEING MORE LOANERS. MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE ALWAYS SHARED EVERYTHING (IN FACT SOME PEOPLE THINK WE ARE JOINED AT THE HIP) AND I CANNOT SEE THIS CHANGING IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS. HOWEVER - I WILL SETTLE FOR JUST GOOD HEALTH!!
