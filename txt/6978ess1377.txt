			 DREAM I'm retired, living in IBIZA, working part time to keep me occupied and meet new people. The sun shines every day. REALITY working full time, refereeing family disputes, supporting & advising and maybe even nagging various nieces & nephews. Wishing it would stop raining and my joints would stop aching and enjoying every minute of being needed.
