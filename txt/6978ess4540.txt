			 Have been busy in the garden and been on a photography course. Easier now having retired from teaching. My back is better since I've given work up. Don't have to bend down so often (with the young ones had a lot of backache bending over and trying to sit on chairs their level). Still worried about the glaucoma affecting my driving.
