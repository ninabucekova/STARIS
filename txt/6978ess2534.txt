			 I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT WHEN I REACH 60 I WOULD STILL BE FIT & HEALTHY AND ABLE TO ENJOY LIFE. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE RETIRED BEFORE 60 AND THEREFORE HAVE MORE TIME TO PARTICIPATE IN INTERESTS I HAVE PLACED ON HOLD FOR MANY YEARS. I WOULD HOPE MY WIFE WOULD ALSO HAV E RETIRED AND WE COULD PERHAPS TRAVEL AND SPEND MORE TIME TOGETHER ENJOYING LIFES PLEASURES INSTEAD OF WORKING SO HARD TO MAKE ENDS MEET. PERHAPS OUR CHILDREN MAY BE MORE SETTLED, THIS WOULD BE A COMFORT TO SEE, AND WOULD ALSO FREE UP A LOT OF OUR TIME AND EMOTIONAL INPUT. NEITHER OF US HAVE A PENSION SO FINANCE IS A CONCERN, BUT WE HAVE A LARGE ARE OF LAND WE OWN, SO HOPEFULLY THIS WILL FINANCE OUR LATTER YEARS. I LOOK FORWARD TO BEING 60 AND THE OPPOTUNITIES THAT THIS WILL OFFER.
