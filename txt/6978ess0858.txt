			 I LIKE TO IMAGINE MY LIFE WILL STILL BE SAME WHEN I AM 60 AND I HAVE STILL GOT THE SAME INTERESTS. PLAYING GOLF AND SPORT AND STILL BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT DIY AROUND MY HOUSE AND ABLE TO BE WORKING WITH THE COMPANY I WORK FOR NOW OR SIMILAR WORK, AND STILL BE HAPPY MARRIED AND SEE MY FAMILY, FAMILYS GROW UP, AND HAVE SOME INTERACTIVE TIME WITH THE GRAND CHILDREN. I KNOW MY LIFE WILL CHANGE OVER THE NEXT 10 YRS WITH LOSS OF FAMILY AND THE GAINS TO THE FAMILY I WOULD LIKE TO THINK I CAN STILL BE ABLE TO TAKE ON ACTIVE'S AND PARTY.
