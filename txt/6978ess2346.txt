			 At 60 years of age I would hope to still have an active and interesting life. My time may be spent pursuing my present interests of walking (long-distance and hill-walking), gardening and horticulture. Reading books, (rather than watching films or television), would perhaps take up more time. Hopefully, my husband will also be home for us to enjoy life together - travelling, walking, family life. My two children may have their own families with which I can offer help and support. My own mother may need more help. My job as a florist may now have become another hobby - I don't imagine I will have to work unless financial matters change considerably. More likely to be giving time as a volunteer to a charitable concern. My biggest hope, and wish, is that my health is still excellent.
