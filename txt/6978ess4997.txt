			 I am still working & looking forward to retiring to live in a sunny climate. I still show dogs as my main hobby, judging whenever asked to do so. Touch wood my health remains good. I get out whenever possible Having made the decision 10 years ago to see more of the world I count myself lucky to have visited some beautiful corners of the earth. Losing mum was difficult and not being a particularly close family she has left quite a hole. With her passing contact with my brothers has grown less. I often look back & wish that I had had children, but it wasn't meant to be.
