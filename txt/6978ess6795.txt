				 National Child Development Study: Sweep 8, 2008-2009 
		 
			 Now that I am 60 I have considerably slowed down the pace of my life. I still work with children in school but have reduced the amount of hours I do. Twice a week I go to {CLUB sports centre} after work to make sure I keep up with some exercise, I also try to go for a walk at least once a week. Home life is still as hectic as it's always been, the studio is still very busy (still lots of washing & bed-making). Now that I have more time I am able to work in the garden a lot more and have the satisfaction of watching it all come together (at last!). My health is good and my life is very peaceful, happy and 'stress-free'.
