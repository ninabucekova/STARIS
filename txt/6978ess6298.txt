			 I imagine that I will still be married and that we will be celebrating our 40th Anniversary. Our children will be aged 34 and 32 and may well have their own children. I will probably still have dogs which provide an interest & exercise. Having suffered recurrent depression, hopefully my health will be better. My husband may still be employed in banking. I may be doing voluntary work but do not envisage being in paid work.
