			 I will most likely still be working in my part-time job (2 days a week) as this finances my holidays - which helps boost morale. I expect my dog will have passed away (he is 14 now) so I will have to walk every day round the village to ensure I still get my exercise. I hope I will be healthy but I've been healthy all my life and I do wonder whether all my ailments will combine into one big one! I don't know whether I will be living at the same address - due to the present economic climate - but I would like to think I might be living near the coast.
