			 I hope at 60, I will still be able to do the things I do now, holidays, walking, taking photos, Embroidery, puzzles. I may still be a carer looking after my mum 24/7. I hope my health as improved a bit, if not that I can still cope with it. I know I will still be taking medication but if im still able to do the things I do now I will be happy.
