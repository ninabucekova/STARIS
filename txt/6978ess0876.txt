			 I have now stopped working and am enjoying seeing my children grow up and possibly see any grandchildren. My husband and I are both in good health and often go away visiting new places abroad either with friends or by ourselves. We go out to the cinema and go salsa dancing still and have meals out with friends. Parents are still alive and much more frail so some time is needed for their care. Generally I am in good spirits and enjoy pottering in the home and gardening sometimes. I feel part of the village and know quite alot of people here. We are generally at ease with our life. D.I.Y is still going on in our house and we are leading a comfortable life.
