			 I am living in {PLACE} ({REGION} Scotland), in a house we have built, on a piece of land, we bought several years ago, overlooking the sea and mountain views in the distance. My husband and I enjoy the peace and quiet up here and the beautiful scenery. We have continued our business of property and garden maintenance, but have enough time to enjoy life too, eg. going for long walks. Also we have a small camping site, on our field, which allows us to meet different people from all walks of life and countries. We regularly keep in touch with family and friends.
