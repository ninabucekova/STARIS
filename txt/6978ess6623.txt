			 I am living in Spain and playing music for a living. I still visit London regularly and my children come over to Spain to visit me periodically. I am healthy and swim every day. I study Spanish once a week with a tutor and I also have cookery lessons. I sing and play guitar in a band and I also teach guitar, and, occasionally, English. I stay in the apartment of a friend in Spain and I let out a small flat in London.
