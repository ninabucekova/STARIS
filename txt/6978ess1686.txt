			 Having survived the economic turmoil of 2008-2010, I am still at work preparing, financially, for retirement at 65. My wife is still working too and my third son has now left home The time invested in looking after elderly relatives has now shifted to looking after new additions to the family & one generation is replaced by another. Whilst being in full employment I am taking advantage of still having a regular income. {WIFE} + I continue to treat ourselves to long weekends away and dining out. We are both still active and I have become even more involved with environmental and conservation issues by undertaking occasional voluntary work for the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust.
