			 I would see my role as a Foster Carer coming to an end. I would see myself slowing down and spending some more time for things I enjoy. I believe my church would still be an important part of my life. I expect I will have more pain from my joints. I don't think I will be working for the church at the level I am now but would still like to be involved. I will still enjoy having my children / foster children round on a regular basis. I can't see my marriage lasting that long!
