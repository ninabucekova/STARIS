			 I am 60 - my son is 22 and (may) still be living at home, as he cannot afford to live anywhere else. My health has deteriated, due to stress, caused by my job, and lack of exercise and fresh air, caused by the fact that as a single parent who is afraid to drive anywhere other than locally, and having a son who is weaker, due to cancer, and lacks interest in the outdoor life, I have not had a chance to walk/swim/run etc. I am struggling to survive financially -(I may well already have died) I will be working to pay off mortgage, so I can secure the house for my son's mortgage/future. As I age, the chance of ever meeting someone who wants a relationship with me diminishes - because men of my age want a woman at least 10 yrs younger. I may now have the chance to learn another language, go to night school, do more exercise (but it maybe too late)
