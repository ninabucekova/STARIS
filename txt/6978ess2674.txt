			 I imagine I will still be working. Hopefully where I do now or doing something similar. I may be working at weekends or evenings in addition to my regular job as my husband will be retired. I hope my children have good jobs and possibly be married or have partners and that I will be enjoying or about to enjoy the blessings of grandchildren. I want to do far more craft activities than I do now and maybe learn to paint. Hopefully my knees will hold up and I will be healthy.
