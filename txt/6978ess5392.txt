			 I hope to be in good health and able to keep active on my garden and allotment. I hope to be able to travel and enjoy new places. I would like to be still close to my children and grandson and hopefully have more grandchildren. I'd like to be able to see my sisters regularly and their exended families. I could possibly be living on a small holding with my husband or even running a small business dealing in flowers, vegetable and livestock. I'd like to run my own music courses for younger students of the flute, and incorporate Art and dance. I hope to see my children develop their full potential in whatever they choose. Id like to still be perfoming as best I can. I want to still be married and having as wonderful at time as I am now.
