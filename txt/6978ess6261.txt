			 I hope to have retired from teaching. I would continue to see family and friends on a regular basis and have Grandchildren To have regular visits to the gym for classes, swimming and walking Guests would visit some weekends and I would travel more frequently. It would also be great if my health was good and I did not need to worry about money because my pensions were good. I might have 'down-sized' my home, but I woul still like to garden and decorate regularly. Hopefully I will be able to achieve a balance between all these activities and my relationships with others.
