			 I am still working for the local Authority in a system support role, which will probably be the case until I retire. I have now moved house to an area outside the city. I make the most of my liesure time spending more time with my wife, on days out, weekends away and holidays. I still maintain my interest and hobby of military history and also try to keep as fit and healthy as I can, through a reasonable diet and exercise. I regulary visit and keeep in touch with our children.
