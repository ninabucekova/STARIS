			 I am still on medication for my mental health problems. My husband and I still spend each day together at home but my depression has worsened since my daughter left home to get married. I cannot go on holidays or on day trips with my husband because he still has a long term physical problem. My main interests are reading and watching television, and I sometimes go for walks.
