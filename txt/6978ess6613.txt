			 I see life with my partner, both children will have left home by then. Maybe a downsize in property, but in the same area. My husband will be retired, so giving us more time together, days out, weekends away, holidays. My interests will be the same, boxier soap, reading, crosswords, knitting, tapistry. Unfortunately my health in all probability will have deteriated as I have Chronic Kidney Diesease, and UNCLEAR funtion is 30% now so this will decline over time which is a very depressing thought. I will not be working as I am medicaly retired already.
