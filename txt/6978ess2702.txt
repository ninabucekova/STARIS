			 I hope I will be retired by the time I'm 60 but if not, I would reduce the number of hours I work to part-time. I would like to think that my husband and I would be in a secure position financially & healthwise to be able to travel. There are a lot of places I would like to visit. We also enjoy dining out & theatre and would like to have more time to do that & relax! I would still like to have a dog and take long walks in the country and spend time with our friends enjoying their company. It would be nice to have the luxury of waking up in a morning and having the choice of what to do, not having to go to work!
