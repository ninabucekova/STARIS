			 At 60 years old, I am enjoying the company of my husband and pets, visiting my son (who should have left home by then!) and his family. Reading and some kind of creative work - perhaps drawing or painting keeps my mind active. I work at a job which I can leave behind at the end of the day; a job I enjoy which does not raise stress levels. I am not working full-time. I go for long walks in the countryside and along the coast. I avoid busy, crowded towns. My health is good - my migraines have been assigned to the past - I am fit.
