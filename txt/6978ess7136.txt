			 I regularly visit my elder daughter in what ever country she is working in at the time. Continuing to sing and act in local amatuer productions and enjoying social activities with the group. Taking regular trips to different countries travelling to interesting places not in school holiday time! Looking after grandchildren at the weekends Supporting disabled daughter to have a meaningful life and continued support in her life. Hopefully retired from work to have time to do the things I've not had a chance to do.
