			 I am rather hoping that things will not be too different!! I will have to work I suspect, so maybe a little less would be nice by then. Hopefully I will still as fit and healthy, as will my husband, and we will be able to continue to enjoy nice holidays, (possibly less active, but hopefully not much!) theatre, meeting up with friends etc. I guess I'm hoping to just very slowly slow down! If I have to!!
