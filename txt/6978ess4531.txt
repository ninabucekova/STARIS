			 At 60 I expect to have retired from the type of job I have been doing most of my life. I expect to be spending more time with my wife pursuing activities that job and family life have thus prevented. More disposable income would allow a better life style with increased leisure time. I would expect my health still to be good and not prevent me from enjoying early retirement. I don't expect to have to work to support my life style, but would not preclude that possibility in some gentle capacity.
