			 "At 60" I play social tennis 2-3 times a week. I walk 4 miles twice a week with my husband. I help to run a church ladies group & young peoples group. We try to eat healthily and take an interest in our children, & watch sport & drama on television. I visit the theatre occasionally. I am not in paid employment. I have aches and pains in my back & shoulders but this does not prevent me from exercising regularly. I enjoy gentle gardening.
