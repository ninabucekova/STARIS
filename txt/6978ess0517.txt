			 I would like my health to be good and to have a job I enjoy doing, hopefully self-employed. I would also love to have more time for my hobbies, including keeping fit, book club, sport etc. I would not expect my children to still be at home, although I wouldn't mind if they were. If my children are happy & healthy & in jobs they love I would be very happy.
