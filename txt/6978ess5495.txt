			 I am still working, but in a different job than at present, maybe 2 or 3 different part time jobs. Both my children have left home but keep in regular touch. My wife and I have moved house to somewhere nearby but quieter. We are both still involved in local activities, including amateur music. My back is still a chronic health problem but I am able to go on country walks and holidays.
