			 I fear my mother may have died by the time I am 60, so the house we share will have been sold. I will probably be living alone in the West London area, though I hope to have found a partner before then to be sharing life/home with. I may possibly have moved to the USA to live with my brothers family. I expect to be still working in some capacity. My interests (still) will be gardening, local theatre group, D.I.Y., animals, eating out, relaxing with television. I will have totally stopped smoking and expect my health to be reasonable, though assume the natural ageing process will have given rise to some aches and pains. My mother is now 84 and when she dies I will be affected hugely. Depending on when this happens, my mental well being may be at an extremely low ebb, or less so, when I reach 60. If she is still alive in 10 years time, she will be 94 and I will probably be in a position of caring for her. I would in that instance be hit hard mentally and find it deeply sad and stressful. If I were to meet someone in the meantime, my life at 60 would be a lot happier than if I don't find myself in a relationship I will, I hope, still have my two cats!
