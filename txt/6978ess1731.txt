			 I hope to be living in a detached house or bungalow in a village or market town. I would like to be involved in some community activities plus belong to a walking and/or cycling club. I hope that I am fit and healthy and that I am enjoying life to the full. I may, though have to care for my mother in her old age. I hope, though, that my wife is enjoying better health and that we can do more active things together. I still expect to be in a similar line of work but looking forward to retirement in a few years time.
