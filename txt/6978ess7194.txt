			 I am looking after my children & grandchildren still, but less often. I would now like to have more time to do more social activities and enjoy my life more. I still entertain & invite family & friends for meals at least once a month. Possibly either fostering children to fill the empty house or maybe we will have emigrated to Austrailia which is very much an option at the moment.
