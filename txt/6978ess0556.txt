			 At 60 I will be retired from teaching but probably doing some voluntary sessions in a local school (supporting UNCLEAR perhaps). Hopefully my husband & I will be grandparents & actively involved in the lives of our grandchildren. As a non-stipendiary Anglican Priest I'll be actively involved in the life of the church & the community, probably very involved with families & supporting individulas in need. Having developed an auto-immune arthritis recently I anticipate being somewhat incapacitated doing flare-ups, but living life to the full. I hope to be learning an new leisure skill eg painting / pottery & to spend time walking & bird watching in the country.
