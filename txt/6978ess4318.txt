			 Having left England a few years ago to live in Portugal, I have found a healthier, cleaner place to live. A place that is free from the P.C. crap that was dragging England through the mire in the 2000's. A place where any money you earn most of it could be kept for you and your family and not given away to freeloaders and spongers thats not prepared to work. I grow my own vegetables & raise my own animals for food, my two strong boys, who came here for a better, safer lifestyle help me with the venture.
