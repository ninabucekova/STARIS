			 I am still working as a social worker Assistant for children & Families social services. I need to work till I am at least 63 to pay my mortage. My son has left home & is working. My daughter has left home & is at University. Money is still tight, as I am paying off debts from bringing up my children. I swim 3x week. My back is still weak & I need to be careful what I do. My depression has stablised - hopefully, but I am not sure if I am happy or not. I will miss my children terribly. I still have a few good friends. I hope to be able to have holidays abroad.
