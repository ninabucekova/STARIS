			 Still working, trying to spend more time with children who will all be grown up but probably still at home! Would hope to be remarried with someone loving Hope my own parents are still there or that I've moved to a bigger house and can house them. Hope I can still cycle, have paid off some of my debt but this is doubtful as the children will need to be financed still as they may be at uni. Hope I am still happy and still have a sense of humour!
