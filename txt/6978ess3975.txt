			 I am now semi retired doing part time driving job for twenty hours per week to keep me sane and my brain active. I enjoy walking the dog daily and enjoy good health. My wife and I enjoy travelling around the countryside, eating out at good restaurants. My home keeps me occupied for the rest of the time doing the garden and small DIY.
