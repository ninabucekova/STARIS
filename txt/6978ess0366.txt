			 I hope that at 60 years I will still be fit and well enough to be doing my hobbies, such as horse riding, Pilates/Yoga, Latin dance exercises and walking. In 10 years time my parents (now 92 & 93) will probably have passed away and so my current caring role for them will have ended. My husband will be 71 by then and I hope he too will be well and still with me and that we will be enjoying a full life in retirement. Also, I hope the Stock Market recovers enough to provide us with a liveable pension!
