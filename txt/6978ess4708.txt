			 I have managed to take early retirement due our mortgage ending - and my husband has also managed to cut down his hours. We are able to spend more time with our Grandson, enjoy longer holidays in {COUNTRY Europe} and more time socialising with friends. My knees and back are still bad which stop me doing much exercise, but my husband now have time to take leisurely walks around our village and on our holidays. If our pension plans went okay we are ok for money and I wouldn't be working as I have worked all my life except for 2 yrs maternity leave.
