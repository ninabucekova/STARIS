			 I suspect that I will still be in social work - but hope not to be! I imaging my daughter will have left home & have a family of her own. I have no reason not to believe that my health won't be good. I hope I will be doing more exercise ! I will still be living alone & seeing friends as I do now. I'd like to be doing more activities & be reading more. My parents will have died by then so I envisage I will have a little more money & so be able to go on holidays more frequently (that sounds so bad!)
