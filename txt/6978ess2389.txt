			 Life at 60 - spending 3-4 months a year (winter) in a warmer climate. Close family life involving our children and grandchildren on a regular basis. Spending more time helping in the comunity. Hopefully semi-retired but still working in some way but not having to rely on earning a living. I would like to still be taking part in sporting activities and keeping fit and consequently feeling good about myself.
