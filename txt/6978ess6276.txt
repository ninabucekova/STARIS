			 I am still living at home with my husband {HUSBAND}, who is still working part-time as a woodland management consultant. I am still working part-time in a bookshop or library, but we are both considering retirement. We are worried about our finances as our pension funds are much smaller since the financial crisis ten years ago. We also have some health issues that are a worry. I am in a choir and am interested in local family history, and look forward to having some more time for this if I can afford to retire. We are very glad we own our own home and have no mortgage to pay. We love to see our daughters and their children, but we don't see them often enough as they live so far away. We are concerned that we will have very little money to help out if the girls or grandchildren need support in the future.
