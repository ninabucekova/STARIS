			 My interests - I will still be involved with showing my dogs, breeding an occasional litter of puppies, judging at dog shows and socializing with the friends I have made doing the above activities. My home life - I will still be happily married to my husband. By 60, we will have been married for 40 years. On a daily basis I will still be walking my dogs, doing my housework/daily chores, and cooking. Still doing a lot of reading in my spare moments. Health & Wellbeing - My health is one of my biggest concerns as I have undergone 3 spinal operations between 40 & 50 years of age, and am in constant, chronic pain and limited with daily activities such as sitting for any length of time & driving. I hope by the age of 60 that I won't have had any more discs rupture in my spine necessitating further surgery. That apart, I am in good health & hope to remain so. Work - I don't go out to work, and wouldn't be able to due to my spinal problems.
