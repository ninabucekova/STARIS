			 I probably wont be teaching then as I find the job more & more stressful as it is & I only work 2 days a week (jobshare). If I have enough money I would like to work voluntarily helping in charity shops at the hospital or maybe even driving a mini bus for the elderly & disabled. {DAUGHTER} my youngest child will probably be at university & maybe the boys will have left home by then too.

My interests will probably be the same ie. going to the gym, cooking, reading etc but the only difference being that I may have more time to do them!
