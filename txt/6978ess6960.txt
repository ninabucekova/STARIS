			 I am recently retired. I am looking at the future with some trepidation as I no longer am doing the job I have been familiar with for the last 35 years, but also with some excitement of the prospect of doing something different. I hope to get the opportunity to do work which will enable me to put something back into society. The children have both left home, which is sad, but my wife and I will have time to travel and pursue our interests. I hope that our health remains good to enjoy the next phase of our lives together and to see our children pursue the next phases of their lives.
