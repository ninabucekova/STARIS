			 MY SON IS 17, I SHOULD HAVE NO MORTGAGE & I AM STILL WORKING, MY DAUGHTER IS 15. MY SON IS WORKING TOWARDS A LEVEL EXAMS, MY DAUGHTER IS PREPARING TO DO O LEVELS OR EQUIVALENT. I AM HAVING DIFFICULTIES WITH 'THE TEENAGE YEARS' OF THE CHILDREN, BUT THEY ARE STILL VERY PRECIOUS TO ME. MY HEALTH IS GENERALLY GOOD, BUT I HAVE TO BE 'AWARE' TO DO THE RIGHT THINGS. MY WORK STILL INVOLVES TRAINING & I AM STILL ENJOYING IT AS IT KEEPS ME IN TOUCH WITH, & IN COMMAND OF TECHNOLOGY. OUT OF WORK, I STILL LIKE TO GO TO FOOTBALL MATCHES, TRY TO KEEP MY FRIENDS CLOSE, & MY FAMILY. Generally enjoying my life, but wish I had done more with my parents
