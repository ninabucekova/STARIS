			 At 60 I would hope to have left the daily grind of full time employment behind, not have to be governed by a clock, and be able to do more or less what I want to do, according to my mood. I hope to have enough money to be comfortable, and enough good health to enjoy the time. Home life will consist of my wife and I sharing the right amount of time together, and of the children visiting and being visited occasionally. Grandchildren would be an extra blessing. I sincerely hope that I'll be able to bend far enough to put my own socks on.
