			 I'm imagining I'm 60. I've now met someone I'm happy with. I still work for the Police, I see my grandchildren frequently, (well those from one daughter at least). I now have a dog, (since my beloved cat died). I go to the gym, but dont over do things. I probably worry too much, as I see these units are not very high. Im interested in photography - love to watch a good tv programme with my partner. Also to do some gardening. Feel good for going to the Gym.
