			 I'm retired or working only a 37 hour week, not the 60+ hours I work now. We are missing our daughter who has left home for further education. I can now find time to do things with my wife, such as gardening, going for days and walking. I have time to get really fit. Money is not a problem but we have to be carefull and not waste money.
