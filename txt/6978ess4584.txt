			 I HOPE I WILL BE WELL. My children are aged 34, 32, 20 & 20 and are all working, happy and possibly all married with some children that I can help look after and see often. I am still doing my voluntary work at the Samaritan Shop & with {CHARITY1 rescue} as a callout officer. My husband & I are still together & hopefully we have a little time for ourselves. I am still exercising, walking the dog, reading, cooking and keeping very active. Fingers Crossed!
