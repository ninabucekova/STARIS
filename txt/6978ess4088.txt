			 Ah!! Sixty years old. I remember being fifty, writing this, as though it were only recently . . . My interests are similar to those then, but perform them with less enthusiasm and vigour. My son has left this nest to challenge his own World now, I wish him well. There is much pride in my heart though it beats at a lesser pace now. My health, I suppose is as good as to be expected, mainly due to the attention given in my youth, physically, but perhaps not in the psycologial sense. As long as I remain philosophical in my outlook my partner might suffer this fool gladly? Work appear more challenging now than then, can't wait to be done with this chore, conforming to the system becomes more tedious, as my time becomes more precious to me now.
