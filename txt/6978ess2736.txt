			 I am doing a professional job, looking forward to a reasonable pension and retiring in a few year time. I am living with my partner and feeling 'comfortable'. I keep myself as active as possible as I enjoy doing activities. I walk, dance & play golf. I suffer from arthritis but it doesn't stop me doing these activities.
