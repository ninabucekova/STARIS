			 Hopefully I will still be working, possibly a few less hours, I hope to still be healthy enough to go dancing at weekends & have the same friends. Our grandchildren will be growing up & hopefully we will have taken them on holiday a few times over the past years. I should still be able to do our garden & hopefully plant it annually as we do now. I hope my mum will still be alive & living next door as she is now.
