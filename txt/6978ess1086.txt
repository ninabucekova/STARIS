			 I still don't feel my age, I enjoy going on holidays with my husband I love having my boys around me and enjoy family get togethers, I have great fun laughing & jokeing with family and friends, I long for the summer so I can enjoy working and then relaxing in my big garden and watching all the wild life round about me, (birds, squirrals, deer) at my own back door, which god willing will be for a good few years.
