			 I continue to be a keen gardener but now grown some of my own fruit and vegetables, as my did when I was a child. I now volunteer for a couple of charities and help at {LOCAL HOSPICE} one day a week. I still gain great pleasure from the birds and flowers around me. My husband is still my best friend and continues to make me laugh, although he has had some health problems which have been ongoing for several years, but he retains his sense of humour which attracted me to him! We love each other deeply and continue to plan visits and activities to share, unlike some of our friends who get on each other's nerves or under each other's feet in retirement. Both our children are happily settled in relationships, {DAUGHTER} having married and produced two beautiful grandchildren, whom we try not to spoil too much! My mum still lives on her own and looks after herself, although the issue of where she will go when this is too hard for her is being discussed openly. I still go out with 'the girls' for our monthly lunch and general catch up on news. I'm happy, grateful for my health and life is sweet!
