			 At 60 I have decided not to retire from my part-time job. My husband however is retiring due to the nature of his work. My daughter is 36 years old and we enjoy time with our grand-children who visit regularly. We are in moderately good health exept for the extra weight we have put on over the years, but we still enjoy walking in the Lake District. My husband has taken up golf and I still sew, doing patch work and quilting as well as gardening on my non-work days.
