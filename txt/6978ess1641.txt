			 Now I am 60 I can afford to cut my hours at work to part time and enjoy some leisure time with my husband and family. Having worked all my life it is nice to have time to enjoy the things that are important to me. I have also been thinking of taking up some voluntary work to help others less fortunate than myself providing I am as healthy as I am feeling now.
