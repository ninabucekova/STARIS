			 I have moved and am living nearer to my family. I am well, and able to go on holidays I wish to, I enjoy all the travelling & exploring, and am able to enjoy walks in the countryside & visits to relatives. My children are happy & healthy & visit & stay regularly. I have grand-children & spoil them. My husband & I are still in love, he plays golf still and I have started an interesting class/or course which I love. I still do voluntary work, and have a small part time job which makes me feel useful. I am content with my life but not afraid to take on new challenges!
