			 I am a languages teacher in a local scondary school. I am still quite fit and active, playing golf regularly. I travel and teach abroad for part of the year in Germany and France. My home life is very comfortable and my relationship very strong. All things considered I am happy with my lot in life. My children are well educated and have good careers. I enjoy the joys my grandchildren bring to myself and my wife.
