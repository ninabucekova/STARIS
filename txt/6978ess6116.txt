			 I would like to think that I won't be working (but not sure how realistic that is!) & enjoying life with someone special. I would be quite happy to do some voluntary work, such as serving tea & coffee at the local hospital. I would like to be able to spend some time in Spain and do a lot of travelling (even just European cities that I love to visit). I hope my 3 lovely daughters will all have good lives of their own & I would also like to be there to help them with their careers & families if I am needed.
