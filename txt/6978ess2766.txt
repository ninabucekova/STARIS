			 I am now 60 years old. I am still with my husband, my children are healthy, happy and settled. I now work parttime as my job mean alot to me and I really enjoy working and meeting new people. My health continues to cause me discomfort but doesn't stop me going abroad 2/3 times per year as I have for the last 15 years. My mortgage is paid off, and financially life is easier, to enjoy the nice things in life. I continue to have very good friends in my life.
