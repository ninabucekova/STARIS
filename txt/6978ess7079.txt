			 I ENJOY GOING OUT & SOCIALISING WITH FRIENDS EITHER GOING TO PUB/BAR OR RESTAURANTS. GOING ON HOLIDAY TO MY VILLA IN SPAIN 4-5 TIMES A YEAR & RELAXING IN THE SUN AROUND THE POOL, BEING BLESSED WITH 2 CHILDREN. LIVING WITH GREAT NEIGHBOURS AROUND ME. WORK IS PLENTYFULL & MY HEALTH AT THE MOMENT IS VERY GOOD, & I DON'T FEEL MY AGE.
