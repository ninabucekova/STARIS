			 So its Xmas 2018, I have another incurable cold, I continue to feel overweight & promise myself to diet tomorrow. The mail arrives & as I bend down my knees creek & my back aches & I wonder if exercise would have improved the joints. but I remind myself that the fittest people I know have undergone heart surgery or smoke 60 a day. Theres a card from my wife enjoying life with her 'mother' in New Zealand - the children have also moved out there to escape the escalating cost of student loans now approaching Â£30,000 each, which is probably why Africans continue to flood in to take their place. I boil the kettle for China Tea & have a bowl of cereal for breakfast & take something out of the freezer for dinner - tonight its UHT meat from ZXZ506 & home grown vegetables. {COLLEAGUE} phones to tell me we have work 500 miles away installing equipment on public transport. I go outside feed the birds, clean the droppings off the solar panels & have a quick glance at the wind generator. The car is charged up & ready to go. I wonder what uncontrollable pests are going to eat my home grown veg this year. I come back in & hear carol singers on my Always on Video link to New Zealand - its nice to see them there - its a long time since they sang here.
