			 I have been retired from my job for the last 3 years. I have a decent pension, which allows me the freedom to travel. My spare time is spent gardening, walking and looking after grandchildren & dogs. I feel relatively healthy and have the energy to persue my main hobby of walking with my husband, and exploring areas of Britain.
