			 I have moved into a nice, quiet neighbourhood. Anti social behaviour and crime is of a very low level here. It is quite rural away from the hustle and bustle of the council estate I lived on for many years. I have retired and have lots of interests and I am still fit and healthy. I don't have lots of money but I manage very well. My children are all happy and healthy, thay all have careers they enjoy. We all meet up at least once a week though sometimes I see them more often. My two older children are happily married and my grandchildren are all well and happy. My youngest son has a career he enjoys and has always wanted to do after finishing university. I am happy with the achievements of my family and myself.
