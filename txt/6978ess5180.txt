			 I imagine I will still be working as a nurse hopefully in the community full-time. I'll have more time on my hands to visit friends, walk, enjoy evening classes. My children would be grown up hopefully with children of their own; I'll really enjoy being a Grandma and being around if they need me. I'm guessing I will be living on my own, with a couple of dogs and chickens for company! I would be content with that. My elder son has Aspergers so he may still be living with me but I would enjoy that. My marriage at present is very rocky, with my husband taking long spells out of employment, soon I believe we will go our separate ways so by 60 I'm hoping to be divorced. It would be nice to have a partner for company - but for that's not the be all and end all. I love my job (not the politics though) love my children and my dogs. Fingers crossed I'll keep healthy - must watch my diet though!!
