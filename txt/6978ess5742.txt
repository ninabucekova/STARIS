			 I am living very comfortably with my husband, we have plenty of free time to be able to follow our interests and have frequent holidays. I have developed my creative potential and enjoy painting, and making flower essences which I make for clients. I look after myself, eat healthy foods, exercise most days and have a healthy, strong, flexible body, my weight always remains the same and is perfect for me. I regularly see my family and grandchildren and we spend many happy times together sometimes on holidays. We have a second home, which can be rented out in holiday season. I work when I choose to and still love it.
