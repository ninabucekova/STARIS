			 AM REALLY PLEASED & HAPPY THAT I'M NOT YOUNG ANYMORE… WITH ALL THE PAIN, TRAUMA, ANXIETY & INSECURITY THAT I HAD TO DEAL WITH IN ORDER TO GROW UP & BE A MAN! GYPSY TOLD ME I'LL LIVE TO 98, WHEN SHE READ MY PALM & LOOKED AT MY LIFELINE. IF THIS IS 50, THEN AT 51, ALL THAT HAS PASSED BEFORE IS JUST THE FIRST HALF OF MY LIFE … & I CAN HERE AND NOW LOOK FORWARD TO THE SECOND HALF. I FEEL THAT I WILL NEVER CEASE TO LEARN, EXPERIENCE, GROW & DEVELOP AS A HUMAN BEING … & SEE MY LIFE AS A JOURNEY & PURPOSEFUL EVOLUTION TO A HIGHER FORM.
