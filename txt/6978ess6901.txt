			 At 60, I will be retiring from my part time job and I think I will be ready for it. In the Spring & Summer months I will hopefully spend my time largely outside gardening, sitting in the sun and walking, maybe even get a dog! In the winter months I'll spend more time cooking, shopping, watching tv, & reading & visiting friends and relatives. Maybe I'll join a social club like the womans institute, any maybe my partner & I will go on a few long stay holidays abroad to escape the cold, winter months. I may not be as healthy as I am now, I expect my joints will play up in later years. I hope I'm still here!!
