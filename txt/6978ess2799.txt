			 At the age of 60, I am still employed in Childcare & education. I am happily married with 4 settled daughters and a number of grandchildren with whom I spend a lot of my spare time. Unfortunately, I still have a mortgage and little spare cash with which I can enjoy a few holidays a year. I am still a regular member of {LOCAL} Church where I am still involved in a number of groups. I still haven't learnt to drive and so walk regularly. Apart from the odd aches and pains, I am in good health and enjoy going for walks, going to the theatre and socialising with friends. Sadly some people whom I love dearly are no longer with us or are suffering with deteriorating health.
