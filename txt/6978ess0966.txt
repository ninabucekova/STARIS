			 All the children have left home and I now have several grandchildren. Life is easier now money is a bit more readily available. I have a few niggly health problems but try to look on the bright side. I am still working but less hours now. I spend time with my friends going out for meals & days away. My husband & I are visiting places we have always wanted to.
