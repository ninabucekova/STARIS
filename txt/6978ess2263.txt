			 Hopefully I will not be working full time - as children are now grown up & left university - can fend for themselves. I hope my husband is still here to share things with me (has brain tumour - every day important) I'll be doing more exercise to keep me healthy so I don't feel tired all the time. Hopefully be able to enjoy life & have some money would help.
