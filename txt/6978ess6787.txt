			 I am still in teaching but my wife is now retired. We are both relatively healthy for our age and I still play golf a few times a year. I love cinema as much as I always did, although only by visiting our film club and never at multi places. Theatre and reading are still my favourite pasttimes, although gardening is something that my wife and I enjoy doing together. Thank God we are in a detached house and no longer plagued by thoughtless and selfish neighbours. I would like to think that I could retire within the next few years and enjoy later life even more.
