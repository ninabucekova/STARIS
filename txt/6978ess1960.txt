			 I would hope to be financially secure, although I shall need to work for quite sometime, albeit at very reduced hours. I hope that I continue to enjoy good health, except I envisage having to work harder to achieve it. Work-life balance & enough rest key features â€¦ (not widely understood in our culture!) The same also applies to my nearest and dearest. I would like to be involved in voluntary work, hopefully hospice work - working with elderly is very rewarding. We will all be old one day!!! Music is a big feature in my life. I would like more time to practice playing violin. I shall always attend concerts, festivals. Luckily folk music doesn't involve any age discrimination. Maybe keep goats again!! Bliss
