			 I am still very active, keeping up my hobbies and outdoor interests. I am doing more travelling because I have more time after retiring. My grandchildren take up more of my time which I enjoy. I will be doing a small part-time job just for interest and pocket money. I still have my aches and pains but I put these down to staying active. I am still interested in learning and have completed some courses on subjects I am interested in such as the natural environment. I will have done quite a bit more sailing but my deteriorating eye-sight makes reading detailed charts and documents difficult. My wife and I have grown closer to each other and have more time to spend together. We do not have any financial worries and are enjoying life more than 10 years ago.
