			 Well I guess now that I've just retired I will have some time on my hands to play some golf. {WIFE} still has a couple more years of work left so its a case of keeping busy doing a few jobs round the house. Im still busy most Saturdays having stopped football refereeing 5 years ago, Im now a qualified assessor, so I'm out most Saturdays checking on the current crop of referees. We still try to holiday at least twice a year. Im still fairly fit, my back plays up from time to time, but it always has so Im used to it.
