			 "60" I'm working in our building firm hopefully looking forward to retirement (thats if our pension that we have paid contributions into for the past thirty years plus is "performing" and the stock market has recovered as 10 years ago things were looking very bleak. We go out walking every weekend and enjoy the outdoor life, swimming and socialising with our friends. Our health is relatively good, just a few aches and pains but nothing to complain about really. My mum is 86 (here's hoping she is still around God willing) and relatvely active (just like my grandma was). Our children are in good jobs and are settled in their lives. Our son has emigrated to Australia and he's enjoying life down under we are hoping to visit him soon. "60" wishful thinking !!
