			 CHILDREN WILL BE FINISHED AT UNIVERSITY, hopefully in successful professions they are happy, fulfilled & successful UNCLEAR; I'm not sure they will have their own homes by then so may be back at home! My husband will be retired but still very active & following his interests full time. I'll be retired - more time to do things with my husband eg travel gardening, walking & to read & sew I might still work part-time eg examining & translating & have time for more voluntary work (braille transcription?) Hopefully my diabetes will still be under control & without complications. We'll probably still be living here & trying to sort out & clear out clutter!
