			 At 60, I would like to be retired. I would like to spend lots of time with my grandchildren, who are an absolute joy to me. My friends and family would play a key part of my life. My friends now are becoming precious to me and by 60, They will be more so. I would like my health to be good, so I can continue walking with my friends and colleagues from work. PS. I would like a good man too!!
