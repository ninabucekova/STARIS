			 I am still in full-time employment. I own my own property where we have been living for the past twelve years. I am an enthusiastic gardener and take regular exercise. I am married and we are planning for our retirement years together. I have various hobbies, yoga, walking the dogs, gardening and dancing. I try to keep myself in good health by taking regular exercise and watching what I eat. I believe the key to a longer life is to be as active as possible.
