			 I am still working but looking forward to an active retirement. My three children are settled and I see them regularly. I have some aches and pains but nothing that stops me from going on walks at the weekend - my husband is also well enough to accompany me. I have enough time, and money, to do some travelling. I may have a part time job or do some voluntary work.
