			 I would very much like to be married to the same husband I have now. I will be a grandparent and that will give the family a lot of enjoyment and purpose. I will be working because of mortgage and debts, but will probably have changed careers, maybe to part time retail work. I would like my health to be the same as my parents who are now in their 80's. They have never been in hospital and are fit and well.
