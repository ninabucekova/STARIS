			 IF I AM STILL FIT AND HEALTHY AT 60 I WILL BE AS HAPPY, I HOPE, AS I FEEL NOW. I HOPE , I COULD STILL BE WORKING AT 60 AND ENJOYING DOING THAT, AS FOR MY WELLBEING, I TRY NOT TO LET SETBACK'S OR UPSETS GET ME DOWN, I FEEL WELLBEING TO BE A 'STATE OF MIND', AS LONG AS MY FAMILY ARE HAPPY AND HEALTHY, THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. I AM A KEEN ANGLER, I ENJOY MY FISHING TRIP'S, IT'S A RELAXING TIME OUT WITH RELATIVES AND FRIENDS, ALL THOUGH IT'S ALWAYS COMPETETIVE WE ALWAYS ENJOY OURSELVES. IF I CAN STILL SAY ALL THE ABOVE WHEN I'M 60 I WILL BE HAPPY.
