			 Being 60 is very good. {WIFE} & I have now been married over 35 years and at last have time to spoil ourselves by going on the odd cruise or having a few days away. We now have Grandchildren and spend as much time as possible visiting them. My time is taken up working but I hope to retire in my early 60's. The garden takes up alot of my time and I now have more chickens. My golf handicap is still higher than I would like but I have joined a club and will play more when I retire. I have also agreed to do more with Rotary over the next few year.
