			 Since my daughter is the most important element of my life, her situation will dictate mine. I expect to be writing more, hopefully be more successful. I expect to be physically fit and financially more secure. I hope to go to the theatre every week, the cinema whenever I want, and travel more. I hope to do more studying for pure pleasure and get more involved in voluntary work.
