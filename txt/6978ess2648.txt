			 When I am 60 years old I hope to have retired and moved to Dorset with my husband. I would love a little house in the country near to the coast. We would both be in good enough health to enjoy going for walks and each do some voluntary work and perhaps a little part time job. I would very much like to be a part of a village community and help those less fortunate. I would feel totally fulfilled, relaxed and happy.
