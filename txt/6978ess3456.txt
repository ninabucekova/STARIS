			 At sixty I would like to be slowing down at work. Maybe handing it over to my children. I would like for money not to be a worry. I only want to be alive if I have good health. I dont want to be a brden to anyone. More holidays would be a bonus. My Veg Garden is very important to me and Re-cycling is also important eg: compost, plastics, tins, cardboard etc . . . I would like to see my children settled and happy with good careers and no worries like we had when we started out.
