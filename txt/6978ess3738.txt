			 If I am working I hope that I will be doing 3 days a week. Hopefully both of my boys will have had a good time at school and will be pursuing either a career of their choice or something that they find satisfying. I hope to be travelling more (money permitting) still riding, gardening and reading. With luck my health will not be worse than it already is!
