			 I am still fit, with good health and well-motivated, so much so I am still working. Probably thinking about retiring from my full time job to do some consultancy work. I am still as in love with my partner as I was the first time we got together. I have fulfilled my desire to visit lots of European capital cities. I have enjoyed many holidays abroad relaxing and enjoying the company of my partner. I continue to be proud of my daughter and am delighted she has done so well. I may even consider getting married a second time!!
