			 I AM NOW WORKING PART TIME AND CARING FOR MY PARENTS. I HAVE GRANDCHILDREN WHICH I ENJOY SPENDING TIME WITH THEM. I HAVE A GOOD SOCIAL LIFE AND MANY FRIENDS. MY CHILDREN HAVE MOVED ON AND HAVE FAMILIES OF THEIR OWN BUT I SEE THEM OFTEN. MY HEALTH HAS IMPROVED WITH A LESS STRESSFULL JOB AND LESS HOURS. MY MORTGAGE IS PAID AND I HAVE LESS COMMITMENTS. LIFE IS EASIER AND MORE RELAXING.
