			 Life is very similar to the life I led at 50. I'm going to the gym regularly, swimming and walking. Playing the piano, reading, art and gardening still fill my leisure time. {HUSBAND} and I spend a lot of time in London with our sons and their families + visiting art galleries & concerts. Our daughter; {DAUGHTER} is married and living in {PLACE1 South West England}-she's working part-time as a speech therapist and is expecting her second child (we have 5 grandchildren and look after them as much as possible!) We've lived in our house for 26 years now - we bought a small cottage in the Lake District a few years ago which we renovated ourselves - a life long dream! I help out at a special school for children with Cerebral Palsy. No paid work. Keeping young is important to me so I do everything possible to ward off aches & pains. Still searching for cause of anaemia - have suffered for 23 years!
