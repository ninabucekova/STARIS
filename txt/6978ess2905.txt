			 At 60 I would hope to be enjoying more leisure time with my husband to pursue our interests in walking and gardening and spend more time together on holiday. I also plan to continue supporting our children and spending time together as a family, especially if they have families of their own. I hope to continue my involvement supporting children with their learning in a local school, either paid or voluntary and would hope that my health will continue to be good so that I can achieve these aims.
