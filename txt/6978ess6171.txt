			 I am reading a novel, after taking the dog for a walk on the moors. I am looking forward to going to the theatre with my wife to watch a play that marks the 10th Year of Harold Pinter's death. It is summer and we are going for an afternoon bike ride in preparation for a tour in a European country. We have retired and are planning a winter holiday in New Zealand. We are involved in the local community, perhaps on the parish council or working as a volunteer for a local organisation. I may be doing some painting, resurecting a hobby I enjoyed but was short of time to do. I will most likely be involved in some campaigning work.
