			 I hope when I am 60 years old I have good health, and money in the bank to do the things I like. By then working part time going on holidays and helping my Daughter to get her own life in order i.e. helping her to buy her own home and car and generally be happy. Working in my garden looking forward to the next 10 years of being as well as you can at that age. I would have had over my company to others by this time. Which is a care company. So I have been looking after others for many years one way and others. Employing 43 carers looking back I have had a good life in all.
