			 AS MY HUSBAND IS 4 YEARS YOUNGER THAN MYSELF HE KEEPS ME FEELING YOUNG AND WE ARE ABLE TO ENJOY THE OUTDOOR LIFE WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD BY GOING FOR WALKS IN OUR BEAUTIFUL AREA. BY THE TIME I WAS 60 WE HAD NO MORTGAGE SO I WAS ABLE TO TAKE A PART TIME JOB IN THE VILLAGE. MY HEALTH IS GOOD AND I AM STILL ABLE TO FOLLOW AND GO AND SUPPORT MY LOCAL FOOTBALL TEAM. AS I AM WORKING PART TIME NOW & AM ABLE TO READ MORE AND LOOK AFTER MY HUSBAND. BETTER BY HAVING HIS MEALS READY WHEN HE COMES HOME FROM WORK.
