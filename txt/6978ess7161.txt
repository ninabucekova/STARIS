			 I imagine that both my daughters will have completed their education and left home. My husband and I will still be living in our current home and both working. Hopefully I will have a better job than now, and be able to afford to travel more. I hope to be able to devote more time to my religion - Christianity. I have no reason to believe my health will have deteriorated badly, except I should lose weight and exercise more.
