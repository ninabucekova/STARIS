			 I am still working as we don't have sufficient funds in our Pension Pot. I will be working with my husband on his business venture in the cafe's. Our children have left home and I have grand children from our daughter which occupies a lot of my free time. I am reasonably fit although my problems with my neck restrict me from some physical activities. I have very little spare time to relax. My family still remains my main interest.
