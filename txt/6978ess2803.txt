			 ONE CHILD STILL AT HOME MORTGAGE PAID BUT I AM NOT RUSHING AROUND LIKE I DID. HAD 3 JOBS IN LAST 10 YEARS, BUT FEEL UNDERVALUED AND STILL JUST ABOVE MINIMUM WAGE. I PLAY LESS MUSIC WHICH HAD FIGURED GREATLY IN MY LIFE. JUST LESS INCLINATION STILL TRYING TO LOSE 'BEER BELLY' WHICH I HAVE HAD FOR 15 YRS! NOT REALLY WELL OFF, BUT THANX TO MY WIFE, WE CAN PAY BILLS AND HAVE THE ODD TREAT - JUST! STILL SAYING I WILL CHANGE WORK DIRECTION, BUT FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO DO SO. STILL TALK ABOUT OUR 'DREAM' HOLIDAY, BUT THIS STILL ALL IT IS?
