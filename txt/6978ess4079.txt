			 Hopefully, I can retire from paid work by the age of 60. Would like to have achieved some goals for example, walking parts of the coastal path in G.B. and starting my own small business. (Most things depend upon the children, as the younges will still only be 19.) Expect health to deteriorate - but only as it will be for everyone else in this age group. Still hope to have many outside interests as I do now. Would like to remain the same shape! As my parents are still both alive and very active, aspects may change if their circumstances alter. They live in the same village and I would not hesitate to look after their (or individual) needs.
