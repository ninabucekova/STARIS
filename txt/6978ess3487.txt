			 I work part-time. I have been in the same job for 18 years because I enjoy it. I have 2 married daughters & four grandchildren. Every now & then my husband & I think about moving somewhere smaller but we love living here. I still enjoy doing the garden, walking & go to a weekly keep fit class. I have gained a little weight over the last few years & my hearing has deteriated & I wear a hearing aid, but my overall health is good. My mother is in her 80's so I visit her very regularly & stay over a few days to help her. My husband has retired. All my brothers & sisters are still alive & we still see each other regularly. We still have at least one dog & one cat. I had a new bike for my 50th Birthday which I still enjoy. I drive a small car run on bio-gas, my husband has built a small wind turbine in the garden which helps to power our house.
