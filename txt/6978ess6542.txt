			 It's Friday lunchtime & I'm just about to close the successful second hand bookshop I've been running for the past 5 years & drive down to {LOCAL} Cricket Club to watch my son make his debut against the touring Australians. {WIFE} is preparing a lecture for the medical school were she is a professor & will be coming down tomorrow with our daughter who has just started a job as a writer with lonley planet travel guides. Health is good although I am starting to get a bit hard of hearing. I'm still writing in my spare time & occasionally take rich Americans on very expensive guided tours to historic sties round the UK. We're still living in PERSONAL. My mother lives with us.
