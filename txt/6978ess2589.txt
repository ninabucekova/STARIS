			 I am still working at the same job, probably full-time and probably looking forward to retirement (hopefully at 65!). My health is maybe the best it has ever been (having discovered I was coeliac at age 42 - after over 30 years of poor health because it had gone undiagnosed and contracting M.E. at age 43 and made slow recovery). I still live alone but spend a lot of time with my children (who are now parents themselves) and friends. I like cooking/sewing/knitting/maybe other crafts/keeping fit through dance/walking. Depression is still lurking but less of a problem.
