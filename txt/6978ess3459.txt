			 At 60yrs I enjoy growing my own fruit & veg & being proud of my self-sufficiency. My kids are grown up now one a successful civil engineer, the other now a qualified & able veterinary surgeon - I am proud of them both. I have a good partner who helps me with the garden & the house. We are in good health & enjoy a fairly reasonable life together. We have our ups & down but are strong together. I am soon to retire so that we can spend more time together.
