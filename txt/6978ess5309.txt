			 I don't know if I'll be doing as many hours of paid work as I do now - I may well be although I am tied to school holidays at the moment and it would be nice to have more flexibility over when to go on holiday & especialy as my children have left school. I'll probably still be doing some voluntary work (maybe more, maybe something different?). I might decide to learn a new skill or take up a new interest or go back to an old one if I have more free time. I'll probably see my children less frequently - they may have their own homes/partners, even children (!). I may have a few aches and pains but I imagine I'll still be reasonably fit, and healthy.
