			 Now that I am 60 years old my health is better as I hav'nt smoked for the last nine years and started a fitness programme at the same time, so I regularly go swimming and do keep fit at the gym with my wife {WIFE} who has already retired. I only work part time now and have more liesure time for activities and visiting family & friends and going on holidays. The children have all left home and are all happy & healthy, and we now have grandchildren who we often have to stay, and take out with us. The mortgage and loans are now paid off, so we can help out the children financially now and then. We have moved to a small bungalow nearby to the rest of the family, and will probably start to spend a month abroad in the winter months in later years to somewhere warm if we have enough saved.
