			 I enjoy the work I do now so hopefully when I am 60 I will be fit and well enough to do the same work. I intend to spend time here in england and also in our second home in Cyprus. With a bit of luck will have grandhildren to also look after. Health wise - I hope to be as healthy in my 60 as I have been in my 40's & 50's. I enjoy reading, sewing gardening which I can't see being any different when I reach 60.
