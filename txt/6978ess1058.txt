			 I will be living in {PLACE1, Europe} with my husband, living a slower pace of life.

Maybe look after the grandchildren in the summer holidays in {PLACE1} to give their parents a break. We hope to have good health and be able to walk a lot and cycle, get to know {PLACE1} even better and make new friends. I would love to continue going to the gym and swimming in our pool.
