			 My wife and I are both retired, we are financially secure and are both in good health. We continue to live in our current home and we have a wide circle of friends (in our village) with whom we frequently socialism. The "war on terror" is over and people are living together in peace. No more dead soldiers! My daughter has become a mother and brings her children to visit often. We holiday 3 or 4 times a year & take part in some form of voluntary work locally.
