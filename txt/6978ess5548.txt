				 National Child Development Study: Sweep 8, 2008-2009 
		 
			 In 10 years time I would hope to be in reasonable health, although I expect my hearing and sight will probably have deteriorated. All my children will probably have left home. It would be nice to think I will still be with my current partner, but as being twice divorced I will not be sure. I will still be working but not in my present job. I will continue to go out to theatre, cinema, restaurants etc, pubs and clubs probably not as often. If the children have left home I will probably have moved to a smaller house but in the same area. I have to many friends here to want to move anywhere else.
