			 I do not see my life changing over the next 10 years. I will still be working for the same company as I enjoy this work to much to change. I will still be looking forward to holidays with my wife & Scubadiving. My health is ok at the moment but will deteriorate as time goes on but I dont want this to stop me travelling.
