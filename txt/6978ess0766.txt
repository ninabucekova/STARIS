			 At 60, I would like to be healthy enough to still be working, playing golf, skiing, walking & travelling - all things I currently enjoy. I wil still be married to {WIFE}, still maintaining contracts with family and friends. There is a distinct possibility I could be living back in my native North East. Having left full time teaching at 50 to pursue an interest in golf, I would like to still be working in a 'golf related' career - coaching, development, ect. Having underdone a writing course I would also like to think I'd had some work published you never know! I'd also like to think I was looking forward to the next 10 years of my life.
