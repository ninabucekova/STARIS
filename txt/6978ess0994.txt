			 Retired from work. I don't want to work passed 60. Children left home. Maybe Grandchildren. I try to keep myself fit & healthy. No ties. I want to travel and look to move away from this area. Pension is a worry and generally economy may prevent me enjoying a retirement I have worked hard for. I want to be free of the people who are dependant on me - children & in-laws.
