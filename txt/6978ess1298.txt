			 I hope that I will still be working - possibly in the same job as now, maybe something else voluntarily. My health should be almost as good as now and I hope I feel less stressed. My home will be mortgage free and comfortable and I will be able to travel abroad once or twice a year. I will not be materialistic or extravagant. I expect to be enjoying walking, swimming and socialising on a regular basis. My children may have left home but if not I will be happy to have them around. I will be content to sit in my garden with a good book and a glass of wine (weather permitting)
