			 The life I lead is boring an mundane. My interests are reading and watching sport on T.V. My home life is O.K. seeing the grandchildren is a pleasure and am still married after nearly 40 years together. Health is not bad, but disability is getting worse. I am in a wheelchair permenantly. I am not doing any work.
