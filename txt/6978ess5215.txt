			 Just retired and looking forward to spending my pension. Planned several holidays with my wife to destinations we have planned to visit for several years. A couple of grandchildren would be fantastic and would love to be involved in any way with their upbringing - provided there was agreement with their parents. Spending more time in the garden, which has been a bit neglected over the last 10 years. Just completed another survey for the NCDS who are still interested in what I am doing after 60 years!
