			 My husband has now retired and I am not working. We live in a much smaller property but enjoy the benefits of a large garden, which keeps us active and provides us with plenty of fresh fruit and veg. We still have 2 dogs - who still love to go out for walks and are good company. We enjoy fairly good health but are realistic about what we can achieve. We are fairly comfortable financially, which takes away a lot of worries, and affords us to enjoy 2-3 holidays each year. Nothing is too stressful !!! (I hope!)
