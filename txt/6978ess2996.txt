			 I WOULD STILL LIKE TO BE ALIVE. HAVING CANCER AND STILL WORRIED I MIGHT DIE BEFORE I SEE MY GRANDCHILDREN DOES WORRY ME ABIT. I HAVE TRIED NOT TO WORRY MY FANTASTIC FAMILY, WHO HAVE KEPT ME POSITIVE ABOUT MY ILLNESS. MY GREAD HUSBAND AND DAUGHTER ARE WHAT MAKES ME GO ON. IF I GOT BETTER ENOUGH AND GO BACK TO WORK, I THINK I WOULD LIKE A PART TIME JOB.
