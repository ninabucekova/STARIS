			 I HOPE TO BE STILL PHYSICALLY ACTIVE I.E. PLAYING TENNIS, GOING TO THE GYM, SWIMMING AND GARDENING ETC. I HOPE TO STILL BE ENJOYING GOOD HEALTH, AND NOT TO BE UNFORTUNATE TO SUFFER A FATAL HEART ATTCK AT 59 LIKE MY FATHER. HOPE MY WIFE'S HEALTH IS GOOD ALSO. IT WOULD THEREFORE BE NICE TO REACH AGE 60 AND STILL DOING ALL THE THINGS I DO NOW - OR EVEN MORE! I CELEBRATED MY 50TH BIRTHDAY THIS YEAR AND WOULD CELEBRATE MY 60TH IN A BIG WAY - NOT SURE HOW YET! MAY WELL AT THIS AGE BE THINKING OF MOVING HOME TO A SMALLER, MORE MANAGEABLE PROPERTY IF NECESSARY, AND VISITING ANY EXOTIC LOCATIONS NOT YET SEEN JUST IN CASE NOT ABLE TO WHEN OLDER.
