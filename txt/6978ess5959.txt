			 EVEN THOUGH I AM NOW 60 I STILL LIKE MY HOLIDAYS ABROAD. WE BROUGHT AN APARTMENT IN {COUNTRY Europe} 10 YRS AGO. SO WE ENJOY GOING THERE 2 OR 3 TIMES A YEAR. I HAVE BEEN QUITE LUCKY WITH MY HEALTH THANK GOD SO I CAN GET OUT IN THE GARDEN WHICH I ENJOY DOING POTTERY ABOUT, AND I LOVE MY 2 NIGHTS OF BINGO WITH A COUPLE OF OLD FRIENDS.
