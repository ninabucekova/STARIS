			 I WILL HOPEFULLY HAVE JUST RETIRED FROM FULL TIME WORK BUT WILL PROBABLY BE NEEDING TO WORK PART TIME. OUR YOUNGEST CHILD SHOULD HAVE LEFT HOME BY THEN SO MY WIFE & I WILL BE BACK TO LIVING AS A COUPLE. I SHOULD HAVE MORE TIME TO FOCUS ON MY GOLF, ALTHOUGH I AM WORRIED ABOUT HOW FLEXIBLE MY BODY WILL BE AT 60 (IT'S FAIRLY STIFF AT 50 AND I HAVE A MILD BACK PROBLEM) I WORK SHIFTS NOW AND THEREFORE IT WILL BE NICE TO GET BACK TO A NORMAL SLEEPING PATTERN - THIS MAY GIVE ME MORE ENERGY. IT WOULD BE NICE TO THINK THAT WE WOULD HAVE GRANDCHILDREN BY THEN (MY SON WILL BE 35 AND MY DAUGHTER 28 WHEN I AM 60) AND I IMAGINE WE MAY GET INVOLVED WITH THEIR UPBRINGING - DEPENDANT UPON WHERE MY CHILDREN ARE LIVING AT THE TIME.
