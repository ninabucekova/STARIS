			 I expect to be retired, hopefully in good health, and able to continue to do all the things I am able to do at 50. possibly I will have moved house, and fully expect to have more grandchildren to enjoy spending time with. I would expect to be enjoying more free time doing what I enjoy, keeping fit and crafts of all kinds. I would not expect to be still in paid employment but would possibly be involved in childcare of my grandchildren.
