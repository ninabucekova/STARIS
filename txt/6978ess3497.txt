			 I am now retired and have been for five years. My husband and I enjoy travelling and do this regularly. We enjoy improving our home and I like to spend time in the garden particularly in the greenhouse. We still like to go walking (perhaps not up so many hills) and going to the gym. We spend our time also helping our three childen by babysitting etc. We also look after any of our parents who are still alive. I do voluntary work related to primary school children eg. Be Friending, reading helper etc. My husband is involved in work at the church still.
