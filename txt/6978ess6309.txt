			 Now I haven't got children at home I am enjoying my new freedom. I can take off when I like for long walks, paint & draw & visit friends. I am involved in Friends of the Earth, and feel it is a very important organisation to support. I grow my own vegetables, live simply and enjoy myself. I am spending my time trying to get the message over to other people that we're all in this together. We've ALL got to help look after our one planet, and each other.
