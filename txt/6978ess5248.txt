			 I AM NOW 60 YEARS OLD I AM STILL VERY ACTIVE AND HEALTHY. MY CHILDREN ARE HAPPY STABLE AND LIFE IS GOOD AND FULFILLING FOR THEM. I SPEND MY RETIRED DAY'S WALKING, GOING TO THE GYM AND OCCASSIONALLY DOING SOME NURSING DUTIES TO CONTINUE TO CARE FOR PEOPLE. I SPEND MY DAYS FEELING CONTENT AND HAVING A HAPPY AND SUPPORTIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH MY PARTNER. BUT IS THIS WISHFUL THINKING ??? IM EVER THE OPTOMIST !
