			 By the age of 60 I hope to have already retired 5 yrs. Would be looking to my wife {WIFE} to also retire. The youngest children (the twins) would be 26 the other two 29 and 31 all will have left home. This could be a time for a massive change, a move down south, to the coast perhaps even a place abroad its something we have discussed. Health would have to be a consideration. If the money market recovers from the current situation I think my finances wouldn't be an issue. We would spend time doing things no restrictions, that were previously there. Walking, visiting places of interests, eating out more having a good time meeting making new friends. If a move to a different location does not materialise then our time would be spent closer to home, gardening, doing more or less the same but in England close to hand hopefully for the grandchildren, all this would be depending on our health. Money can't buy it also can't buy you time.
