			 At 60 I'm entitled to retire as I become eligible for my pension. I anticipate I will be doing either voluntary work on a part time basis or I may have already finished my present employment and embarked on a new career. I like ideally to carry on in some form of paid employment probably part time until I'm 65. My children should hopefully be self supporting. I hope to be having a lot of holidays still playing golf and socialising. I may have grandchildren by then & be helping my children to look after them.
