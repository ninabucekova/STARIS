			 It's great being retired! I never have a minute - so many friends to meet up & go out for lunch with. I can now go on holiday during term time - cheaper prices at last! I'm ready for my bed at the end of the day, with my busy life. At least when my morgage ends I'll have a bit more money to spend on me. I've got time to cook & experiment with new recipes My diet is much healthier as I've got more time to buy fresh food & time to cook proper meals instead of rushing in & being too tired to bother & then eating conveniently! Glad I've not gone grey! Have to go now - I'm due at the bowling club with my sister - they've roped me into the team now. It's a family affair!
