			 I'm retired from full time work, but still working a little part-time in the private sector. I am doing some voluntary work in the community. I put a little time aside to do some writing. We are selling the house & buying a smaller place. I have regular breaks abroad, we have a property abroad. I see my children (and grandchildren?) regularly. I am careful what I eat & exercise regularly I still go to thai chi. We have a dog & I take the dog out regularly. I see friends regularly & keep in touch over the internet, by phone & face to face. I am interested in UNCLEAR classes in familiar & new areas (creative writing, drawing or art maybe?). I still sew & knit.
