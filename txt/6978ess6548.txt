			 I expect to be in the same job, but considering retirement. I will be living in the same house, but considering moving or down-sizing when I (and my husband) retire. I expect my children will be living in the London area - although they are in university in Leeds & Sheffield now - I expect they will return to London. I hope I will be fit & well enough to be able to travel, taking a few holidays a year, UK & abroad. I hope I will still be healthy - my parents are now in their mid - 70's, with some mobility problems & diabetes (mother) but doing well for their age & I hope I will do so too. I keep a check on my weight & take more exercise in an effort to keep healthy. I have no plans to change my job (at the House of Commons) as I am very happy that, it is very secure. I would be delighted to have grandchildren!
