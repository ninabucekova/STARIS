			 I am now 60 years old and am content and happy as I've realised my lifetime dream of living by the sea in Cornwall. I live a modest life, I've got everything I need, and share my life with my wonderful partner of many years. I'm suffering a little with a few aches and pains but on the whole I can't complain. I've got a part-time job locally and through this have made more good friends and integrated well in the local community. I only wish I could have been here years ago, but I have no regrets of my life, I've been very lucky and much loved.
