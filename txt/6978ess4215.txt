			 By now I have stopped working full time and hopefully spending more time travelling. No family home to maintain. Just a small apartment in a small town and a reasonable sized home in France. I would also like to spend more time with the friends and family that have missed out while I've been working and bringing up a family. I'd also like to think that my finances would be in good order.
