			 I will probably still be working as a Physiotherapist in Pain Management and doing some "light" DIY on the side. I see myself still living in Fife but there is a slight possibility that I might move through to the West to be nearer the family. I would love to be able to retire at 60 but unless my financial situation changes - I will need to work to pay my mortgage. I do have some problems with my knee & hip due to hockey & football in my younger days - but my goal is to keep active & keep my weight down in order to stem any more "degeneration". I will hopefully still enjoy my wine & real ale from time to time. I hope that I will be a little less anxious than I am now and that my mood will continue to stabilise as it has been doing for the last 5 yrs.
