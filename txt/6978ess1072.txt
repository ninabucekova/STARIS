			 I am now 60 years old I have moved to a lovely bungalow with a lovely garden, it is not huge but of moderate size. I have good neighbours who are very friendly, but do not invade my space. I often eat out and visit the local pub for a light beverage. I still enjoy going to the park and a walk at the seaside (with fish & chip) dinner. I am still healthy & able bodied. I am not rich but I am very comfortable on the financial side. I feel my family now appreciate me more I am no longer a bank or a slave to them. I also appreciate them more now.
