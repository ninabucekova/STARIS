			 I would be able to afford to go to the gym or attend yoga classes so I could strengthen my back & be more active in general - & avoid back pain! I would be able to socialise more (be able to afford it) and go on holiday. I would be able to afford train fares to visit relatives in other parts of the country more often. I will still be working, but hopefully, will be an accredited counsellor (I am qualified but not accredited my employer will not permit me to use my working hours towards accreditation). I may have moved to the countryside - closer to either my sister or my brother. I will still be living on my own and may be writing a book.
