			 I have cut down on my work commitments or perhaps have retired. I may have moved to a smaller house with my husband. We travel together to places that neither of us have been before. My 2 daughters (now 27 and 29 years) feature heavily in my life and they visit us and we visit them. I have more time now to go walking as well as following other interests such as theatre, visiting exhibitions, etc. I continue to have close family ties especially with my sister and brother and their families. My health is reasonable and I make an effort to keep fit.
