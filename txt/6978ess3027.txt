			 I've retired from my job and living in a rural setting, growing my own fruit and vegetables and keeping a few animals - chickens, a pig, maybe a cow. My husband joins me in these activities. It's great when the grandchildren come to visit. Travelling plays a big part in our lives both within England and abroad. Luckily we're fit and healthy to enjoy it. Also visit the children as often as possible - depending where in the world they're living.
