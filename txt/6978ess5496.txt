			 AT 60 I HAVE GOT BACK INTO MY PASSION BIKING (MOTORCYCLE) SOMETHING I DID IN MY EARLY DAYS, I ALSO DO A LOT OF HILL CLIMBING. HAVE MOVED OUT OF THE MIDLANDS AND HEADED TOWARDS THE COAST, I AM FIT AS EVER FOR MY AGE AND FEEL GOOD ABOUT LIFE. I AM STILL WITH MY PARTNER {PARTNER}. WE MET IN 1990 29 YEARS TOGETHER (NOT MARRIED) I STILL WORK, BUT IT'S MY OWN BUSINESS, STILL LIKE A PINT DOWN THE LOCAL AND ALWAYS SIT OUTSIDE IN THE SUNSHINE.
