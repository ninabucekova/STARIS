			 Retired but still working a couple of days a week doing something I enjoy to get me out of the house and meeting others. My health is good and I am able to go on walks with my wife and dog. Have an active social life, dancing. May have moved to a smaller house, doing DIY to get it low maintenance for future years. Family are still close and the children visit regularly, hopefully with grandchildren. Still able to go abroad on holidays twice a year. Still happy with my life.
