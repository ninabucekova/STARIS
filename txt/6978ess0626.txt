			 In ten yers time I am hoping that my life will be very similar to now. The mortgage will be paid off and I would aim to spend a bit less time travelling and more time at home. I'd like to develop the business potential at our farm and perhaps become more self sufficient - growing more food and having a few farm animals around - sheep, pigs, cows etc. I'm sure I'll still be working-being an architect is too much fun to give up. Health? - so far so good - my grand parents lived to an average age of 82.5 and both my parents should make it to that age - hopefully I will too.
