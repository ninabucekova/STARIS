			 I am still married and we are both in good health for the most part. We are both retired from work and doing the things we've been waiting to do for a long time - spending more time on ourselves and our interests. I am writing more - my books are selling well. I'm active in the writing community and attend conferences and meetings more often. We have moved away from London to a house in the countryside - near {PLACE South West England}. We have some land and I've cultivated part of it for herbs and fruit trees; there is a wildflower meadow and a small wood. I spend time sitting outside writing or reading. I'm healthier than I was aged 50. My stress level has reduced, I'm eating regularly and more healthily. I'm getting more exercise with gardening and country walks. I'm comfortably off financially - we both have our pensions plus the money from inheritances and our new work - my writing and my husbands craft business. We host educational/social breaks for creative writers and enthusiasts. Our social lives have improved and more time to spend on people, and on each other. Our marriage is stronger and we are both happier and more relaxed than ten years ago when life was stressed and we were coping with jobs and family and health issus. That is all behind us now and we are enjoying life at last!
