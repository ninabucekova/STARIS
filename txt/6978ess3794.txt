			 At reaching 60 years of age, I am now retired from work (after working all my adult life). My husband and I are now able to enjoy our times at a less frantic pace, and are able to reap the benefits of financial stability (being able to enjoy a comfortable lifestyl, to travel and being able to support our sons in their lives, whether it is practical, emotional or financial). Our mind is to continue in good health, be happy and contented, and hopefully be blessed with Grandchildren. PERSONAL
