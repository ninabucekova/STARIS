			 I have a 40 year old toy boy, the reason I am fit and healthy and young looking for my age. I live in a coastal town in the South, perhaps {PLACE South West England}, overlooking the sea. I keep pigs and chickens, have a few close friends, and am very content. My two sons have gone far in their careers, and are very happy.
