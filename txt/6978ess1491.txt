			 I just cannot imagine being 60! I can't believe or even feel 50 as it is! It will be an honour to reach 60 as many people don't. It will be great to be alive, happy & healthy, and appreciate & love the skin which I am in even more. I will not be conforming to fashion, but will wear elegant clothes (& expensive jewelry!) I hopefully will continue to be extremely active & working a lot less, exploring new ventures & experiencing life & culture, travelling to places yet to be seen. Time to learn the piano & play my Dad's wonderful piano. Continue to research family tree. Learn to sing & dance (properly!) Nurture all my lovely friends that I have met throughout my life, ensure we all keep in touch throughout the rest of our lives. Possibly live abroad for half the year. Keep my body young, active & toned. Continue to enjoy "me time" food & drink. Most of all enjoy my precious family, my loving partner & my adoreable daughter, all of whom are a huge part of my life & make it so special. No doubt by then I will be a very proud "Grandparent"! On being 60 I hope to enjoy my life, having many life experiences to have achieved exactly what I want!
