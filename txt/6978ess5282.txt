			 Unfortunately it is more difficult these days (especially in this economic climate) to be able to predict with any confidence what we may be engaged in & how we may be placed in 10 years time. By contrast our parents would have planned when to retire and had an idea of their financial situation & security. Life is far more unpredictable. I would like to think that I might be in a position to retire but our future will depend largely on my husband's employment and the next 10-15 years. If he is unable to retire I am sure our lives will remain unchanged albeit that the children will be more independent! Also health will be a factor - and an unknown one. I wish I had a crystal ball! All I can say is I would hope I will always be able to carry on working in some capacity whether this be part-time paid or voluntary work and to enjoy any spare time with my husband, children and maybe grandchildren. Is that enough? PERSONAL
