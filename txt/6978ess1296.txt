			 Hope I'm retired then, although my son would be at university. Perhaps working just 1-2 days per week as psychologist. My relationship with my partner is v. important to me. I hope he is working fewer hours/retired so we can do more together eg. learn a new language, become volunteers with the National Trust some voluntary work. More time for hobbies eg. paino, gardening. Not certain my health will be as good as currently - arthritis is a problem in my family, so that's likely. Financially, we should still be very comfortable. Plans to travel more extensively. Not sure whether we'll move house - it depends on what our new neighbours are likely (most of them are currently in their 80s)
