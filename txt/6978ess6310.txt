			 I imagine myself to still be at the hospital working in radiology. My mortgage is paid off & I am enjoying my golf & travelling to far flung places. My grandchildren are in secondary school but sadly my parents are both dead. My health as usual is up & down but I am still able to do most of the things I want to. I have moved recently because I have inherited some money.
