			 At 50 yrs old, I hope that when I'm 60 I could do the same thing as I am now. I enjoy my family life, my wife and home arrangements are fantastic. Both my teenage children could be more organised/tidy, but overall 'No' complaints. Work is good, my walking interest keeps me healthy and my weight down. When I'm 60 there will be no children at home. I'll miss them but the home will be tidy!! Perhaps my wife & I could go on holiday more often.
