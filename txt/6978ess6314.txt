			 I WILL HOPEFULLY STILL BE WORKING AS A PAINTER & DECORATOR, SUPPORTING HUDDERSFIELD TOWN, AND ENJOYING TIME ON MY HANDS AT WEEKENDS. HOPEFULLY I WILL NO LONGER BE LIVING BY MYSELF & WILL HAVE FOUND SOMEONE WHO WILL SHARE MY INTERESTS. MY HEALTH WILL NOT BE GREAT BUT I WILL STILL BE ACTIVE. FRIENDS AND FAMILY WILL MEAN A LOT TO ME AND I EXPECT I WILL BE A GRANDFATHER. IM HOPING MY EMOTIONAL LIFE IN MY LATTER YEARS WILL BE BETTER THAN MY EARLIER YEARS.
