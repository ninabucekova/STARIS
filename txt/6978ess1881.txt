				 National Child Development Study: Sweep 8, 2008-2009 
		 
			 My children will have left home (although Maybe not permanently - many seem to return after university) so I may have more quality time to spend with my wife. Life should be rather less hectic with more opportunity to do what we want. My mother who I visit pretty much every day may have passed away. She is increasingly infirm and reliant on me for physical & emotional sustance I will miss her very much. I will be financially less secure, facing later life with inadequate pension & savings. I will continue to work until the day I drop (I am an energetic & wrestless person so this holds no fears - I am not the retiring type). I hope my health holds up (I've been very lucky so far) I will worry endlessly about the fate/ life choices / partners my children choose.
