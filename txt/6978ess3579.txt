			 PERSONAL@Interests My main focus continues to be the family although, with {SON1} hoping to go to University in October, only {WIFE} and I will actually be living at No32. I still enjoy watching sport and continue to follow {LOCAL TEAM} with my pals for college days. I'm rather less closely involved with the local cricket, rugby and football clubs now that the boys are that much more grown up. I'm still an avid reader and enjoy all types of fiction and other material which satisfies my continuing interest in the world around me. Home Life {WIFE} and I expect to move to a smaller property later in the year assuming that {SON1} is successful in being accepted at college. {SON2} is in his second year of reading Architecture at the {UNIVERSITY}. We are currently considering the merits of relocating to {PLACE1 South West England} but leaving {PLACE2 South West England} would be very difficult for all of us. Like myself, {WIFE} currently works from home on a part-time basis. Health & Well-Being I'm still just about managing to keep my BMI below the Obese limit. I'm afraid that I enjoy my beer and cheese too much to manage much more. With less time spent running the boys around these days at least I have more time for myself which I like to use, in part, by getting involved with the U3A Walking Group. I'm also still playing the occasional game of golf, tennis and squash. I'm conscious of my memory getting progressively more unreliable and I fear that I may end up suffering from some form of dementia like Dad. However, mainly through being in full control of my daily routine, I continue to take a great deal of pleasure from life and I'd like to think that most people see me as being a cheery positive type of chap. Work Although I do the odd bit of book-keeping and market research to help keep the wolf from the door, most of my work is done on a voluntary basis these days. I'm still on the parish magazine, Marlborough Jazz Festival and cricket club committees. I also serve as Treasurer of a national Aperger's Syndrome charity. PERSONAL
