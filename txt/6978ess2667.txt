			 I'M STILL LOOKING BACK TO MY CHILDHOOD, WISHING THAT I COULD GO BACK, THINKING ABOUT MY MUM, FEELING SAD THAT I ONLY HAD ONE CHILD AND DON'T HAVE ANY GRANDCHILDREN. LOOKING FORWARD TO RETIREMENT AND HOPEING WE CAN SELL UP AND MOVE TO MAJORCA. SAD AT THE STATE THIS COUNTRY IS IN, COMPARED TO WHEN I WAS A CHILD. FEELING AFRAID TO GO OUT BECAUSE NO ONE RESPECTS ANYONE OR ANYTHING, AND THINGS JUST ARNT SAFE. THINKING HOW FAST MY LIFE WENT AND HOW DIFFERENTLY LIFE COULD HAVE BEEN HAD WE HAD PLENTY OF MONEY. MISSING FAMILY THAT HAVE DIED AND FEELING THAT MY HEART IS BREAKING, LOOKING BACK TO EVERYTHING THAT WAS HAPPY AND SAFE WHEN I WAS A CHILD AND ALL THOSE LOVELY MEMORIES.
