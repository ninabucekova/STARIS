			 I 'hope' that by the time I am 60 my life is much more settled than it is now. I hope to be married in a happy & secure relationship. I hope to have suceeded in becoming a 'good' teacher. I hope that my children are happy and secure in both their personal & professional lives. I hope to be able to do at least some of things can't do now for one reason or another (health permitting) e.g. travel, learn to play the piano again, time for my grandchildren - in short be happy & fulfilled.
