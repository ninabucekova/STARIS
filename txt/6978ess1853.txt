				 National Child Development Study: Sweep 8, 2008-2009 
		 
			 My children have left home now and I have moved into a smaller house. They visit now and again. I am retired now and able to do some of the things I want to such as travel and sightsee a bit more. My angina is always there but I manage to walk a couple of miles a day and keep my weight down. I do occasional work for the Police and this helps my earnings keep my head above water. I miss my kids dreadfully but have met a woman from the post who is similar to me and the future looks good.
