			 I will have paid off my mortgage and hope to have retired & be working part time (as a UNCLEAR) if I am working part time I may do some voluntary work such as walking dogs for the local dogs home or doing something for the elderly. I hope to have stopped smoking and be as healthy as possible. I am very active now and intend to continue to walk everyday, swim regularly and also go to the gym. I have recently found happiness in a new relationship and may have remarried, if not, I hope we will be living together and my partner is likely to be working as he is younger that me. I will continue to see my friends regulaly and my family and spend quality time with them. I hope to have a dog because I can't now as I work full time. I hope to make the most of life.
