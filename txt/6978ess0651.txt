			 Most days I just need to get through the day at the moment, but I do hope that in time I will find some personal happiness. At present the most important thing is looking after my mother and my sons who I hope will have made me a Grandmother by the time I am 60. I know I will not be able to cope with this house and garden by then so I hope to have a more low maintenance home by then. In time I may be able to take paid employment when I am no longer a full time carer. I had planned to be retired by 60 but changes in my family situation mean I will need to work till I am older.
