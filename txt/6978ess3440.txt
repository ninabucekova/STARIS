			 I am feeling very relaxed these days!! My new hip replacement has been a great blessing. My part-time gardeing business is actually expanding!! The winter months enable me to become even more involved in the local community and I am confident that I can be elected to the local community council. It's really great to pursue my interest in welsh railways including their construction. I'm truly enjoy being a grandad and traveling to visit the family with my wife is great fun. I'm enjoying the opportunity to take evening classes and gain further qualifications. Life is great!!
