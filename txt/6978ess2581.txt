			 I remain employed and am planning my retirement. Being still relatively healthy, I am arranging to complete a few years contract doing V.S.O work in the developing world. I still enjoy looking after my house and sitting out in the garden reading when the weather is fine. I still go on several holidays a year to places of cultural/historic interest and still have my friends of nearly 40 years visiting from abroad as we are all now nearly retired. Cooking & entertaining is still a pleasure and finally I have also learned to play "golf". I've made some new friends and take the time to visit "old friends" who are perhaps now less able than before. Physically active still, I haven't put on too much weight and can still achieve a lot in one day. I keep up to date with technology and try to master new skills.
