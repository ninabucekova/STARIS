			 Still married and living here, but my 3 kids may have left home to hopefully do something interesting with their lives. I'll still be working part-time - and also working part time in something like B & Q to make ends meet! Does the NCDS need any researchers in a decade? I charge reasonable rates! I still hope to be doing 1/2 marathons, playing football and having an active social and cultural life.
