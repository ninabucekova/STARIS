			 I will still be working, hopefully full time for the Fire Service and possibly part-time in addition, or volunteering in some capacity. I do not imagine any dramatic deterioration in my physical health. I hope that my mortgage will be paid off and that I will be able to afford the occasional holiday or weekend break without feeling guilty. I will still be playing music with friends going to concerts and visiting friends. I will still be living in the same tiny house but everything will be orderly and the garage may be converted to provide a small studio area. I hope my children will be working in their chosen professions but do not imagine they will be property owners, and I am not expecting grandchildren to have appeared by then either.
