			 I hope that:- kids left home & have own, fulfilling lives. My husbands health hopefully not too bad, but may be limiting our activities Still happy living with him. loving my work, working hours that suit me, maybe 3 days a week. Maybe we'll have moved house - but stayed in the area, near our friends my health still good. Still enjoying walking in the countryside around us - though probably without a dog by then. I expect my parents & father-in-law will be dead by then, so no more concern for their health & well being.
