			 At 60 years old my interests are still keeping me active: I love being outdoors body-boarding, walking and gardening. I enjoy going to the gym and swimming, hoping all these activities keep me healthy along with a good diet. Homelife is very content with a loving husband and 3 grown-up children all enjoying life and a couple of grandchildren which are such a bonus to life.
