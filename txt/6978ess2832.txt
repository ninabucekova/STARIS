			 Still teaching & still in the classroom as well as in management & training as I love working with children. Still active physically - attending the gym at least 4 times a week & still doing the active classes I am doing now. Both children would be living their own lives; away from home; in jobs; possibly married; possibly be a grandmother. Possibly living in New Zealand, Australia or Canada. No longer paying a mortgage; saving for retirement. Travelling abroad more (if still living in this country). Going out more to theatre, events etc as children not around. Spending more time with my husband. Fit, healthy & active.
