			 I live on my own. I work full-time (mostly nights) in a chip shop. I stay accross from The school my gran kids go to. I see them before they go to school I see them when they finish school, along with their mothers I dont see them at week ends but they stay with me on Mondays (my day off) I go swimming 3 times a week and swim for 1 hrs 15 mins not stop - I also attend a computer class, I kept myself busy and try to be heathy as I have been very depressed and wanted to take my own life in the past, and I dont want ever to feel like that in the future. I do feel happy in my life now and feel good about the changes I have made and hope to be doing the same when I am 60yrs old (If not better)
