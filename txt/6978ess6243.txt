			 Financially I don't think I could retire at 60, but it would be nice if I could cut down my hours giving more time for leisure persuits (walking and rambling) and time for some voluntary work too. If I continue in good health I intend spending more time with friends and family and using my free bus pass if that still exsists in 10 years time!
