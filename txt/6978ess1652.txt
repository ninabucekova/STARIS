			 I will be looking forward to retiring from teaching. My son will have been to College/Uni and have a good enough job to take me down the pub!! My daughter will be 14 and probably going through all the angst of adolescence. I will probably have become politically active with a 'far-left' group again. I will be reasonably healthy for my age & may have started to go grey (I havent yet) I may be involved in ruuning a group for the Woodcraft Folk. I may not be with my current partner and could be living alone or with someone else
