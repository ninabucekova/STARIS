			 Now I am 60, I have just started my retirement I think that we have been lucky (and sensible) to have enough pension and savings to enjoy a comfortable - though not extravagant - retirement. We are looking forward to being able to travel more widely. My husband, who also retired recently, is also in good health. Our children are now 32 and 30 years old and are enjoying fulfilling careers. As they do not live with us, we enjoy visiting them regularly. We usually enjoy good health and, although my athritis occasionally flares up, we can still take part in our favourite activities like walking and gardening. We both enjoyed our careers in teaching and feel that we did make a difference. That is a good feeling to have.
