			 At 60 my interests are still sport. I like to travel a little & enjoy holidays. My home life is settled with my girlfriend. My 2 children are also settled leading happy lifes. I still like to go out for drinks or meals but also enjoy entertaining at home with friends. My health is still good. Though a few aching bones but nothing too serious. I hope to retire at 65. Im still working hard, but it keeps me sane & ables me to to the things I enjoy.
