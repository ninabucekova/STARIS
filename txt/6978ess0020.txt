			 My life will be very different because my family will have left home so I imagine having more time and money. I will need to have a new challenge so that my husband and I can fill the gap. We are already thinking about possibly doing more sailing, walking etc. We will eat out more, entertain more like we did before the children. I may be looking after my father more. I will visit {COUNTRY America} (where my husband comes from) more and possibly have a vacation home there. I may still be working it will depend on the economy, pensions and how challenging my job is by then.
