			 I am happy with my wife, have my partner children & grandchildren to keep me on my toes. I shll do a part time job to keep my brain active. We have enough money to enjoy life to the full from investments made previously. I travel as much as I can & hopefully still go dancing, although it may not be my beloved salsa! I will have more time for reading, gardening and doing all the things I want to do.
