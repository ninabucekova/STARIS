			 I am 60 - still working but hoping to reduce my hours. Probably in the same profession (it's all I know!) Still married and probably in the same house but not adverse to moving to a quieter neighbourhood. If in the same house hope to have enough money to upgrade various aspects. I imagine I am a grandmother by now and involved in caring for grandchildren to allow their parents to go to work. I would like to be healthier than I am now as it has taken me 51 years to recognise that I need to lead a healthier lifestyle if I am to have an independent old age. I would still enjoy walking and swimming and maybe have a dog to look after. I like to think I will be able to enjoy holidays and see new destinations.
