			 GOODNESS What a Question! Well? I work in a Nursing Home though I never planned this career. I think I've always wanted to do a job to the best of my ability, and when I feel I've reached that level thought: what more could I do to make a bigger difference? I feel a great sense of how much I've learned and how far I've come. This I feel applies to my home life, and health and well being (though I did plan a homelife etc.) Its hard to imagine I'm 60, though I feel it!
