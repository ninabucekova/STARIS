			 I would like to think that be the time I am 60 I will be able to shorten my working week, take more time off, and enjoy my social interests. My children will be enjoying the prime years of their young adulthood and the time and money that this frees up will give me new scope to enjoy such delights as sailing. I recognise that my health will not be as good as at 50, but I hope this will not limit my enjoyment of the wonderful things in life. I think this change in family focus may change my relationship with {WIFE}, my wife, but this is a challenge that we will will face together and work through together, as we have always done when faced with change.
