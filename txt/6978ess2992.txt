			 TIME HAS FLOWN BY, I FEEL THE OLDER YOU GET THE FASTER IT DISAPPEARS. MY INTERESTS DON'T SEEM TO MATTER ANYMORE, THEY HAVENT FOR YEARS I'VE ALWAYS PUT OTHER PEOPLE BEFORE ME. I'LL NEVER CHANGE. INTEREST MAINLY WATCHING MY SON GROW UP - HOPEFULLY WE CAN PLAY GOLF TOGETHER ONE DAY. HE CAN PAY. HOME LIFE I WOULD CONSIDER EMIGRATING NOW, IF I COULD QUALIFY, NOT SO MUCH FOR MY SAKE, BUT MY SONS. HEALTH & WELL BEING I'VE WORKED VERY HARD FROM 16-45, AND STILL ONLY GET ABOUT 4 HOURS A DAY SLEEP. SUNDAY 5/6. MY DAD PASSED ON AT 64, THINK I'LL BE THE SAME!
