			 I would like to have time to enjoy the following golf, travel, walking, voluntary work at a local Rugby League club. I would hope to remain healthy and mobile with others around able to do likewise. Maybe by aged 60 we will be grandparents and enjoying that side of family life. I would enjoy undertaking some limited consultancy work in sport.
