			 At 60 my disability has worsened although the new medications have left the functions I can still do for myself less painful. The local Authority are still no nearer to providing suitable housing. Hobbies are fne but they cost money, exept the free pastimes of say Walking, picnics but mobility is and has been painful and I am sure always will be now. {PARTNER} my partner is a star and has stood by me 40 years now! Plus the kids still visit regular than most kids would given they are 37 and 28 and have their own lives so we are lucky - just not able to enjoy the stuff normal, able people take for granted, and there's precious little to do here for them. So we do what we can after rain you can only expect fair weather so hope is still the order of the day + 60 and still here. Its hard - preferable to the alternative! and who knows - they may start to listen! too.
