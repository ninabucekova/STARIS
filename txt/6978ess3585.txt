			 I hope to still be walking regular with my husband and dogs, and that my 3 children have a settled life and hopefully there own property. I would like to retire at 60 but depends on finance, and that both my husband and myself reach 60 years old. I do worry about my husbands health a lot more than my own, as he does a very manual job and finds it a lot harder now he is in his fiftys, so I think he will be really struggling at sixty.
