			 HOPE VERY MUCH THAT ALL OF THOSE I LOVE ARE STILL WITH ME, AND IN GOOD HEALTH. FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOW IN PAIN, I HOPE THAT THE STRUGGLE IS OVER, WITH NO FURTHER LOSS OF DIGNITY. IF I HAVEN'T WON THE LOTTERY YET I HOPE THAT I'VE STILL GOT THAT GOOD CONTRACT, WORKING IN A GOOD PLACE, WITH GOOD PEOPLE. HOPE VERY MUCH THAT I'M STILL WITH THIS LOVELY WOMAN, WHEREVER WE ARE NOW, ALTHOUGH I'D PREFER SCOTLAND TO {COUNTRY Asia}! HOPE THAT MY LITTLE DAUGHTER IS HAPPY, AND SETTLED, AND ALMOST READY TO GIVE ME GRAND-CHILDREN TO SPOIL, HOPE THAT I'VE STILL GOT MY GOOD HEALTH THAT I'VE BEEN SO LUCKY TO ENJOY. AND I HOPE THAT I'LL STILL HAVE ALL OF THE ABOVE WHEN I'M 70!!
