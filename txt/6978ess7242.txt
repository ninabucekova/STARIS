			 At 60 I would hope to be living in the country, probally not working - but perhaps helping in a school or local community. I would like a dog to be able to go for long walks in the countryside. I would like to travel - mainly in Europe & visit cities & seaside areas. I hope I can move to an area where I can make friends & join local groups. My children should be settled & finished University, so I can start to enjoy my time, but I will need to help my mother.
