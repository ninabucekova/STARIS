			 If I reach the age of 60 I will still be working & if it goes through to 65 (OH JOY) May be ill be getting up at 5.30 Five Days a week for Min pay Just to make ends meet, as Im dong now. I guess I would have seen the passing of both my parents, but thats something I dont want to thinK about too much. I can not really see me reaching 60 as most things just look so Black to me, but like a Clown, I will put on my face for the World, & let them see me happy when deep down in side Im dead already.
