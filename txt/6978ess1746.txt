			 By this time I expect to be working a 40 hr week in an office environment on a low income trying to make ends meet with little chance of improving my circumstances due to my age and competition in the job market. If I had a job as a SAP inputter/technical clerk working in the aircraft industry that would suit me fine but then again I can't be too fussy at my age. I would want to retire by 65. My children 14 & 12 would be settled in at the local state school (or private if I could afford it) in the hope that they have long and fulfilling lives. We would live in a 3 bed house in Fishponds or somewhere near where good local facilities exist in a virtually crime and drug free environment. I expect to stay in my relationship with my long term partner but as I already realise nothing can be taken for granted in relationships. Hopefully my health is no worse than it was in 2008 and I would like to be free of stress and family problems. Finally, it given the time I would like to continue with my archaological project work and transport campaigning.
