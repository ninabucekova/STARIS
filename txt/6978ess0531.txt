			 I am still doing my Karate & sport I love my wife & Family more than life. I hope I'm still working in my current type of work, which I have always enjoyed. I enjoy working in my garden & walking with my beutiful wife. My grandsons keep me busy, and I love to watch them in there sporting activities. My health is still good as I look after myself and still consume hundreds of vitamin tablets! I still have one true friend {FRIEND} and he is Italian and a little weird!
