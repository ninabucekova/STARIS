			 I have stopped working full time. I am glad to spend more time with my wife, some of it visiting friends and family. I am generally contented and much more relaxed than when I worked full time. I am a little concerned about having enough money for retirement. I am very proud of my children, but am still not accustomed to them living away from home. I am not sure where to retire to and this concerns me. I feel a little guilty, maybe fustrated, that I am not using more of my time contructively. I am generally healthy, but my arthritis has become more noticeable and often prevents me from following physical pursuits that I would enjoy.
