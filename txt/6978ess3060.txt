			 I would like to be retired. Living in a nice house with my wife with enough money not to have to worry and to do things not have to worry and to do things without worrying how to pay for them. To be still well enough to enjoy any hobbies I have. To enjoy my children and grandchildren when they come for holidays, and to have a wide circle of friends and interests.
