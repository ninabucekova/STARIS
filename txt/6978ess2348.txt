			 I am about to get married for the 2nd time in February 2009, Therefore when I am 60 I will be celebrating my 10th wedding anniversary! Still very happy & fingers crossed, continuing to enjoy excellent health. My granddaughter will be 10 years old & who knows, I may have another Grandchild by then. I will definitely be retired, still playing tennis & spending more time in our house abroad.
