			 At 60, I would want to be leading the same life as I am now, though with my husband retired and spending time at our house in Spain and keeping house here in the UK, dividing our time between the two.

The only thing I would like to do is have a holiday cottage to let, which can be summer let or 6-monthly, which would not be too much of a tie.
