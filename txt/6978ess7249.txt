			 I would like to imagine that in 10 years time I would be retired, perhaps doing some part time work. In good health, enjoying regular holidays at home and abroad with my wife. Pottering in the garden and generally relaxing enjoying life with a comfortable income/ pension. I imagine spending more time with my wife who would also be retired and spending time with the family (2 daughter) who hopefully may have families of their own by then!
