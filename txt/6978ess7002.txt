			 I hope to be living in the same house with my husband. My son will be happy with his life and our good relationship will continue. I expect to continue in my job, as a nurse/carer and greatly enjoy all my friendships made there. Family relationships are good & rewarding, hopefully this will continue. I expect to continue my hobbies, singing, walking, motor-cycling, swimming and travel. My only concern is the unpredictability of my husbands job, He has been with this firm for 36 years.
