			 At 60, I hope to be well and active carrying on with exercise classes, cycling and walking. I also hope to be still going sailing at weekends and for holidays. I intend to be doing some part-time teaching or tutoring at home as the children will be nearly 17 and 18. I would also like to do some more travelling with my husband.
