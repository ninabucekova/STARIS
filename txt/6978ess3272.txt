			 I will be working full time - probably in same job as now - mainly because of changes in retirement age for women and will still be paying a mortgage! I do not currently have a partner - would like to think that I will meet someone - but if not I will probably be living alone. Of my two children, only one lives with me and I would expect her to be living independently in another ten years time. I thik that I enjoy good health and would hope that it is still as good when I am 60.
