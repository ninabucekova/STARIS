			 I MAY STILL BE WORKING IN THE SAME JOB AND I HOPE TO SEE SOME FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN THOSE TEN YEARS. I HOPE STILL TO BE IN GOOD HEALTH, CERTAINLY BETTER THAN OTHER PEOPLE MY AGE - STILL EXERCISING REGULARLY AND GOING SKIING EVERY YEAR OR TWO. I WILL STILL BE MARRIED TO MY WIFE. THE CHILDREN WILL ALL BE INDEPENDANT AND WORKING. SOME OF THEM WILL BE MARRIED AND WE WILL HAVE A FEW GRANDCHILDREN. MY WIFE AND I WILL HAVE MORE TIME TO OURSELVES, ALTHOUGH IF THE CHILDREN LIVE NEARBY, WE WOULD LOOK AFTER THE GRANDCHILDREN FROM TIME TO TIME. SOME OF OUR PARENTS MAY HAVE DIED DURING THIS PERIOD, BUT SOME OF OUR TIME MAY BE SPENT IN CARING FOR THOSE WHO SURVIVE INTO THEIR 90s.
