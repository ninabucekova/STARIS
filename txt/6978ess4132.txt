			 I hope to be retired from teaching by sixty although I cant imagine what that would be like - to have finished your worklife. My hope is that my son will have gone to University and have found job/lifestyle fulfilment. I imagine that I will spend my time sleeping (bliss) reading and hopefully having some energy to do things in the house and garden. Fifty seemed quite scary but sixty even worse!! I hope my husband will take up golf or potter in a garden shed as I cant imagine being together 24/7. I look forward to being a glamorous granny!
