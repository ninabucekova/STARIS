			 At 60yrs old I am enjoying life. I am still active & work part time or am doing voluntary work. I suspect I will be child minding a few hours per week for my grandchildren while their parents pursue their careers. I will enjoy every precious minute. My husband and I will enjoy time away probably in a second home in {{PLACE1 Scotland}, Peace & quiet. I will still enjoy a socail life with family & good friends. We will have a dog & walk lots! Time will also be spent with my parents. Huge changes can happen in the next 10 yrs as we all age - gracefully or disgracefully.
