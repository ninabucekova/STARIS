			 I celebrated my 60th birthday in March - such an odd feeling really, time has passed so quickly and I choose to think of myself as a 40 year old. Don't think I look too bad for an old bird, but maybe the face-lift at 55 has helped ! I haven't worked since I was 45, yet I've never been bored. I've always had the capacity to fill my time & amuse myself even as a child - still trying to master Spanish (despite living a lot of our time in Spain) doing Pilates (helps the back pain) gardening, keeping house & generally helping out those who need me most. {HUSBAND} & I have now been married 38 years & its good to be sharing interests now that he's retired. We've finally achieved our dream of having a small place in Spain which we share with the family. I've never regretted not having children, but love seeing my neices & nephew & their children. I miss my parents terribly, but feel sure we'll meet up again one day. Roll on the next ten years!
