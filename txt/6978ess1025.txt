			 I anticipate being in good health, and reasonably comfortable financially. I expect to spend more time by then in my holiday house in France. I expect to have grand-children. I may no longer have dogs by then but I will still walk regularly. Hopefully I will be retired from my business, and possibly I will be earning a little money from writing books. My main residence will still be here in {PLACE Scotland}, in my wonderful community, but I will spend time in Glasgow and London as well. Up to 2 months a year might be in France. I would expect to have my grandchildren to stay regularly, but when I am 60 they will probably still be small.
