			 In 10 years time I shall be dedicated to my work so I imagine that my home life will remain a little solitary. My children will be grown and making deep inroads into their respective careers & lifes. Economically I would expect the Country to still be in poor shape which will have an impact on my own financial well-being. I imagine that I will need to work at least until I'm 65 prior to retiring - and then only on a modest income. I see few opportunities to alight from the tread-mill and I worry therefore that my health will suffer as one puts in considerable hours & take inadequate recreation. PERSONAL (29/12/08)
