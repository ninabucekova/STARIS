			 In my dreams at sixty, I would like to have enough money to not have to work full time. A part time job or voluntary work would keep my mind and body active! A move to a cottage in the country would be ideal. I would have more time to spend with my family and hopefully would have several grandchildren to spoil, and at least 2 holidays a year to look forward to. In reality, I don't see my life changing too much in the next 10 years. Hopefully, I will not be working in such a demanding job. With any luck the grandchildren will arrive and as long as I have my health, family & friends, then I'll be happy! However, I'm always looking for new challenges - so who knows ?!
