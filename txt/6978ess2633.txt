			 MY LIFE- AS IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN - IS BUSY AND VARIED. I HAVE A STRONG CHRISTIAN FAITH, A LOVELY WIFE OF 39 YEARS, AND TWO MARRIED CHILDREN WITH YOUNG FAMILIES. MY JOB IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IS STILL INTERESTING AND SOMETHING I LOOK FORWARD TO MOST DAYS. MY WIFE AND I STILL LOVE TRAVELLING AND CONSTANTLY ENJOY EACH OTHERS COMPANY.
