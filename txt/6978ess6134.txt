			 I am in good health - keeping fit - taking regular walks. Now living in the most beautiful valley in the Black Isle by Inverness. We've always loved Scotland & our summer holidays to the Highlands are so very important to us all as a family, so actually living here is just amazing - Fresh air I would only work occasional hours in a local GP surgery... just to keep my hand in & brain ticking over! We love the grandchildren coming to stay/or going South to see them. Our house would have wonderful views over the valley & I would be quite involved with the neighbours & local events. There is such a fabulous community spirit & I would enjoy being a part of it. {HUSBAND} & I love the local music & we enjoy going to our local village hall for a session with guitars/recorders violins and voices. What fun. Nigel plays golf but I'm not sure if I'd take that up or not. I would keep in contact with our friends from the South & have them to stay/email or keep in touch via email etc. I can't wait. Life would be just great.
