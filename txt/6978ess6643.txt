			 In 10 years time my younger son will be twenty-seven so I would expect to have fewer family responsibilities and less ferrying around to do. I'd like to be more organised with my work (I am self-employed) so that I have time off. I would hope that my partner and I will have more time for ourselves and health to enjoy it.
