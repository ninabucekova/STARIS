			 Hopefully financially secure so not having to do paid employment but if necessary would be working part time. Would prefer to be doing voluntary work 1 day a week in charity shop or hospital. Still living in the same house, mortgage paid, no credit or debt. Still married, daughters move out settled with husbands/partners. Would like to be a grandparent by the time I'm 60. Healthwise - more aches and pains, arthritis in knees worse. No serious problems. Interests - socialising with friends - meals out. Enjoying short breaks away from home, gentle walking in the countryside, theatre trips. Involved with local clubs - church, cricket, guiding.
