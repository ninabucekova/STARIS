			 I am still working although my Husband & I have purchased a two bedroom holiday home in Majorca for our forthcoming retirement. We still spend a lot of time with the grandchildren and take them swimming, walking and as I have always liked the theatre we visit Edinburgh and Newcastle frequently. So you may gather, that although I am still active, I am slowing down, but I feel as healthy as I did 10 years ago and you never know, when I do retire maybe I'll take up a new hobby such as salsa dancing which I have always wanted to do but have never found the time in which to learn.
