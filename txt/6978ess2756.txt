			 I imagine that at 60 I will only have one or maybe no children living at home. there will be a gap in my life. I will make a clear decision to take an even more active part in being a Magistrate. I will still be singing and working with our property business. I think my health may not be as good but if I still go to the gym I think I will be fit. I may travel more and take a greater interest in art. I hope to have more time to spend with my husband.
