			 I would like to think now having reached sixty years of age my life has moved forward in terms of my professional work and experiences. I sincerely hope to have met a new partner and even be remarried. Of course my children will have developed their own lives and hopefully following their dreams. {SON} should be singing professionaly and {DAUGHTER} practising psychology. I am sure my health will have been problematic although a new hip will probably be in place. As far as where I live - who knows as long as it feels like home!
