			 Well, I'm now 60 - which means I could retire soon - but being Mrs Busy Knickers no doubt I will continue doing the volunteer work-campaigns. Would be nice to try out some of the new courses and raise my technological skills to the point of competance-and beyond- My health has improved since the advances in diabetic treatment has finally filtered down to the remnants of the NHS. So glad to have a little more energy, means I can get involved with the little grandchildren. They provide a wonderful chance to act like a fool without being judged as totally insane! Enjoy doing the crafts and creative stuff too, old style & new. Just hope I have enough money to pay the rent and bills - Hope that "Solar & wind energy for all" gets the go ahead.
