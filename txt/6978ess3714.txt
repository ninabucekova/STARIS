			 I have taken early retirement in order to help my husband in a successful consultancy business from home. I also spend a few hours each week carrying out voluntary work for a local charity. Our spare time is spent enjoying walking the dogs & looking after our numerous cats. We also have a rural interest in North Yorkshire where we spend as much time as possible. Our daughter is enjoying a lucrative career in a corporate law firm. She is very happy, still single but has a longterm partner. We are very happy, healthy & enjoying life.
