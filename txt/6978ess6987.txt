			 I will have finished work. Still married with all the children grown up, the last 2 finished university and working - hopefully not too far away. I am happy living in this area, so would probably still be living here. I would be enjoying walks, swimming and reading, at the moment I don't really have a lot of time to do these. I hope that I am still healthy and mobile. My mum had very bad arthritis and was in a wheel-chair to go outside and I really wouldn't want to end up like that. I would be looking forward to having Grandchildren in the future.
