			 I have retired from teaching, only working occasionally to supplement my income when necessary. I live near my son & daughter & spend a lot of time with them & my grandchildren. I am in a rural area & keep a few animals & run some art courses from home. I am very busy following all my interests - art, F.W.B.O etc & although I don't have a lot of money my home is comfortable. I am able to spend some time abroad each year - perhaps travelling or volunteering in Africa or Asia. I have continued following Buddhism & it is a large part of my life. I feel better & healthier than I have for the past 20 years since I gave up the stress of work & enjoy doing what is important to me - I think this could be the best time of my life.
