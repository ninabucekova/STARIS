			 I've reached retirement age from {WORKPLACE telecommunications}, but because of the pensions issue's, I've got to work another few years to get my maximum. The same applies to {WIFE}'s job, so we'll just have to postpone the long summer in Greece. We're going to celebrate our Ruby anniversary later this year, so we'll have a good bash for that one. We're both still bowling but play together a lot more now. I'm glad I gave up smoking 13 years ago, I'm feeling the benefit now. I'm looking forward to the next 10 years, travelling a bit more & maybe a bit further afield, mind you, Australia is a long way to see the grandkids.
