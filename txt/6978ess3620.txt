			 I would hope to be retired from teaching on a sufficient pension. I might be doing some other part time work or voluntary work. I expect to remain single, but in a fulfilling relationship. I would hope to have more time to pursue my current interests and possibly take up new ones. I would hope to still be fit and healthy for my age, as I have never smoked, always taken some exercise and been conscious of eating and drinking in moderation. I am looking forward to a long and happy retirement.
