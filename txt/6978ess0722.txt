I am still reasonable healthy, maybe my knees will be a little stiffer as this something I suffer with or Maybe I might have or be thinking of having a knee replacement. I would still like to work with young people in the comunity as I do now or on a voluntary basis. I have saved a nest egg and started to claim my works pension so hopefully, I would still be able to go out walking with the dog and having meals out with friends and family.
