			 I will be living with my partner and we will own our own home and have no mortgage. I will probably still be working but hope to have enough spare cash to travel, visit friends and go out for meals. I will continue to enjoy visiting art exhibitions, going to the pictures and attending music concerts. My health will be good although I may be wearing glasses for reading. My home life will be happy and comfortable and I will maintain a good relationship with my family and my partner's family. I hope to still be working in I.T. but in a more managerial role than at present.
