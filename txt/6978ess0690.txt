			 I am thinking more and more about my health and retirement plans. Having the funds available too be able to take more holidays at home and possible winter sun breaks. My children have settled and forfilling jobs with funds to enable them to purchase a home without stretching themselves financially. Possible working part time during the summer months and only full time during the winter months enabling me to travel and visit places on long weekends.
