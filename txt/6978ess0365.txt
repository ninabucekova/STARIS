			 Now I am 60 I feel life is great. I have retired from teaching and my children have all gone to university. I have the time to travel and see places I have always wanted to see. I can now go on holiday and spend longer at my destination and see what life maybe like for the locals. I have time to continue playing the sport of badminton even though I may not be so active as before. On occasions, I still teach but it is now, when I want to rather than having to. I am able to spend more time with my husband and do things together. Although I am a little slower in my movement and it takes me a little longer to do things, I feel great.
