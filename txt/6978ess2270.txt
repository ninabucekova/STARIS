			 I hope to be running a business with my partner and possibly with my older daughter. Maybe helping her with a young family, with her living close by. I would like to be helping my parents with their elderly lives. I would like to still be climbing and teaching/coaching. I would like to be able to afford a holiday in Cornwall each year. I think my joints will have become 'creakier' and hope it doesn't restrict me too much. May be I'll be resigned to waking early and not being able to get back to sleep.
