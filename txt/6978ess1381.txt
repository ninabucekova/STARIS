			 I still work fulltime and live in a small but comfortable home. I enjoy playing golf & working in the garden. At least once a month I meet up with friends for a night out & every few weeks drive to various parts of the country to visit family. Apart from the odd ache & pain my general health is very good. In fact my life has not changed drastically in the last 10 years since I was 50.
