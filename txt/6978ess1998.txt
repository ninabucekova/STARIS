			 I am now 60 years of age, and I am still working but only part time, working in retail for the last 30 yrs. It is nice to spend a lot more time at home with my family. I go out at least once a week for a meal and meet up with friends for our weekly quizz. I am looking forward to going on holiday with my family. I can not believe I worked all those years without taking a holiday. I am going to make up for the lost time and enjoy myself. Because of my health, it limits me to what I can do. I have had a back problem for many years after hurting my back at work. I still do a lot of needlework which I enjoy very much. I have made quite a lot of things sitting in my garden. Its a more sedate life I am leading now and enjoying every minute. I have all my family nearby that is all I need.
