			 I live with my partner of 14 years with a cat and dog. We have a large circle of 'biker' freinds and neighbours I now work in an occupational therapy unit of a local hospital. Weekends are spent on the allotment or riding out to rallies on our aging trike. My eyesight has deteriated, so I no longer pursue modelling in detail. I make the occaisional pot and still paint. We visit our children and grandchildren several times a year and they come and stay with us during holidays. We live modestly and relitively comfortably although money is kept on a short leash.
