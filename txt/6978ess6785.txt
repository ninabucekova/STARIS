			 I feel that a new chapter in my life has begun, as I have retired from the Bank. My husband is also retired which means we have more time to see our family and friends, and we can also spend more time enjoying hobbies. We both like to travel and to take holidays both in the UK and abroad. My health is still a little up and down but doesn't stop me from keeping active. I still look after my father and I work on a voluntary basis helping the elderly.
