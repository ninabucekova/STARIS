			 I am 60 years old, retired and living in the sun. I live on the island of Cyprus on the Southern/Greek side where everyone speaks English and they drive on the same side of the road as in England. I live in a lovely house with my husband who is also retired. I spend my days very leisurely - housework in the early mornings then laying by the pool reading and swimming. A couple of times a week we go shopping. Some days we meet friends for lunch or dinner at night. We lead a quiet, happy, contented life. Because of the Mediterranean diet, the slow pace of life and the wonderful climate we are both extremely healthy and well and feel ten years younger than we actually are.
