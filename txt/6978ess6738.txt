			 I would be looking forward to (if not) retired having moved to a smaller house in preparation within the same area. My health would be good and I hope to still have lost the weight I am currently trying to lose! I would have got my Open University degree and be taking evening classes for enjoyment, active mind and making new friends. Hopefully my financial situation would allow me to live a comfortable life with a couple of holidays a year. My family will have increased through nephews & neices having children and I still hope to have close ties with them.
