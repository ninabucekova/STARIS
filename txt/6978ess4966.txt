			 I RETIRED AT 60 AND NOW AM ENJOYING THE RELAXING PERIOD OF MY LIFE. I AM NOW ABLE TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH MY WIFE AND FAMILY. I HAVE A FEW WORRIES NOW THAT THE MORTGAGE IS FINISHED. I LIKE TO POTTER IN THE GARDEN AND HAVE SHORT TRIPS AWAY SOME WEEKENDS. I AM LUCKY THAT MY HEALTH IS OK ALTHOUGH A FEW ACHES AND PAINS DO HIT ME NOW AND THEN. ALL IN ALL I AM GLAD I RETIRED WHEN I DID. I'M AT AN AGE WHEN I CAN STILL BE MOBILE AND ALSO NOT BE BURDEN TO ANYONE.
