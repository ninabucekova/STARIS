			 I DON'T THINK YOU CAN PLAN THAT FAR AHEAD AS LIFE CAN CHANGE SO SUDDENLY, BUT I WOULD HOPE TO BE WELL ENOUGH TO BE STILL WORKING & ENJOYING MY HOBBY OF MY ANIMALS WITH MY DAUGHTER & GRANDDAUGHTER. I MIGHT HAVE MOVED TO A SMALLER PROPERTY. I HOPE TO BE STILL MARRIED BUT MY HUSBAND HAS BEEN UNWELL FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS SO YOU LEARN TO TAKE EACH DAY AS IT COMES.
