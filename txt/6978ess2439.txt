			 I am living in a village. Just the two of us at home now with a Labrador dog. Love going for long walks and visiting the local pub. I am still working and feel physically fit from walks and playing golf. Our family visit as often as they can as we realise they have their own lives and careers. I would like to feel I am at the most happiest and contented period of my life, so far.
