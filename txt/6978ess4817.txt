			 My children will be financially independent, They will be 23 and 26. I hope my health remains good, but expect some decline. I will have more spare time, less looking after children time. I expect my business to have developd and to thus be financially secure. I expect still to be working but perhaps a little more selective on what I get involved with. I hope and expect to use my financial position and spare time to travel and explore more with my partner. I hope to be in a steady long-term relationship, which looks likely.
