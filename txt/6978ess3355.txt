			 My third novel is selling well. I do readings and book tours from time to time, as well as singing in a band of old gits playing pop songs. Our son is 22 and works in {COUNTRY Asia}, so we have an apartment there, as well as our same old house here. My health is good, though my knees are creeky. My wife's in excellent health, too. We travel together, go the cinema and read a lot. We're very happy.
