			 Health and wellbeing - currently I am in, and enjoying both 'good' health and wellbeing, providing I maintain my diet and maintain my regular exercise regime I expect to maintain my current health status (my Grandmother skied until she was in her lae 60's, walked every where including up mountains well past 75) so I forsee no reason why I can not emulate her. Home life and interests - we do not currently forsee any need to move from our present location. As our children will be older by now, we expect to be doing different things as we would have more 'free' time, such as travelling in Europe not necessarily by car, or exploring the UK more. It might be possible that we could at this time be grandparents as well. Work - we would like, by this time to be retired, however this may turn out not to be possible due to the economic conditions which may prevail at this time. I am currently not sure whether I would be still working for my current employer by this time.
