			 I am still working, looking forward to retiring abroad. My health & well being continues to be good and I look forward to a long & happy retirement. I am expecting to be playing golf on a regular basis & travelling. My relationship with my children is very good & I see them regularly. I have remarried but this time for companionship & friendship rather that love.
