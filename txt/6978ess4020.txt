			 Having recently retired I am now spending three months of the year in {PLACE}, {COUNTRY Europe} where I have an apartment. I have just bought my fifth BMW car which will be my last. My general health is ok although my knees give me some trouble from time to time. In England I like to spend my time pottering in the garden and playing golf. In Spain it is just nice to get away from the winter cold.
