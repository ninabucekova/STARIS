			 10 years on I hope I have the life I wish I had now. 10yrs I am living in a house of my own it is wonderful to live in a house without a job attached to it, it is small but has a nice garden and a parking place. (no space for trucks trailers and chain saws. Hoorah). I work part time at the hospital and have time to spend decorating & gardening. I love baking and make cakes to take to work & for friends. I still walk a lot and have learn't to play the harmonica better. I exercise daily & my health remains excellent. I often remember happy times with my wonderful parents without worrying about them as they are both now dead.
