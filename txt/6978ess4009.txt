			 Now that I have made it to 60 years of age with the Children settled in resonable careers. I will still spend most of my time at home doing housework, reading and other odd things. My younger partner should still be providing most things and I will be drawing on a small personal pension to cover my small expenses. I hope to be able to continue assisting a few elderly people in the village with odd jobs such as grass cutting + hedge trimming etc. Hopefully the blood pressure will remain under control so my mobility and unrestricted travel will still be available.
