			 As was 50 to 40, I am now 60 doing the same manner of things when I was 50. Still have the mortgage, children to worry about - even tho' the oldest has her own home. Looks like I'll be working past 65 onto 70ish (maybe) - but I feel okay in myself. Still enjoying my hobbies & having some spare cash a few more holidays.
