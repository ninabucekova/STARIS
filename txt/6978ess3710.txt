			 I don't like the thought about being 60! I will probably be retired, though doing some voluntary work. I hope to be fit and healthy and able to do the things I do now. I look forward to spending more time with my husband. I expect I may have to do more for my parents as they will now be in their eighties, but I don't mind. My children will be leading their own lives but I will still do anything for them, and hope that we will still be a close family
