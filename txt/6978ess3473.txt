			 I run two businesses at present and with the economic climate I hope they survive, so I would pretty much be enjoying a similar life to what I have at present. Hopefully more cash to spend and more time to enjoy it. Hopefully my parents will still be with me and we still enjoy our holidays together. I enjoy golf and fly fishing so that will stay the same, my health "touch wood" is very good and long may it remain so. My family are very important to me and they are my main concern, we are currently helping them financially, and with advice. If I have the same lifestyle at 60 as I have now, life will be ok.
