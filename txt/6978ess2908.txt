			 I am still working as a freelance interpreter but not doing the market research work, as a big lottery win has enabled me to work less. I am living in Germany with a boyfriend 10 years younger than me who plays in a rock band. I spend a lot of time visiting friends in Mexico. I still follow football & keep my eye on Brentford and Spurs scores and try to get to games when in London. I still go to rock clubs & heavy metal gigs.
