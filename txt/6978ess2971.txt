			 I am still working, full time, but maybe no longer self employed. I am living in the UK, but not necessarily in the same area as at present. My health is good, but I might expect age-related niggles. I hopefully have a secure income which allows me to travel . I have maintained, and extended, my interest in local life and group activities. I have maintained my circle of friends, possibly now married.
