			 Hopefully I would have retired from my current job. I would be settled into my own place in the caribbean and working on a voluntary basis for the development of the local community. I would attend my place of worship on a regular basis - at least weekly. I would have enough money to travel a lot and see parts of the world that I have yet to visit. My children would come to visit me on a regular basis and I will return to the U.K. at least yearly. Healthwise I hope to be as fit as I am now with minimal aches & pains.
