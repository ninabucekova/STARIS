			 I hope both myself and my husband can retire at 60 and afford to do the things we didn't have time or money to do before like travel and see old friends. I'd hopw that we would be healthy and fit enough to fen walk and do the sports we'd like to do like cycling archery (him) and skiing. I'd like the children to be settled in careers which were fulfilling and made them financially independent and had settled stable relationships. I'd hope we all had good health and be happy and content. I would just review what I wanted to do & what others wanted or needed me to do and probably compromise.
