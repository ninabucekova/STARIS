			 I AM NOW 60 YEARS OLD. THE CHILDREN HAVE NOW LEFT HOME AND STARTED THERE OWN FAMILIES WHICH I AM VERY INTERESTED IN. MY HEALTH IS GOOD WHICH ALLOWS ME TO PLAY GOLF 3 TIMES A WEEK AND MY BUSINESS IS STILL TAKING UP MOST OF MY TIME AS I NEED TO STILL WORK TO HOPEFULLY LEAVE A FINANCIAL BENEFIT TO MY CHILDREN FOR THE FUTURE.
