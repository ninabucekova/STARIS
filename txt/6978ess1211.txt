			 I either retire or just about to retire. My children have moved out & may have families of their own, not so much mess, giving me more "me time" - I'll be doing the things I want - cinema, theatre, more out doors, travelling. May occasionally offer to babysit but no childcare. Spending lots of time enjoying myself along with my husband. Health I expect to be much the same, still fat, but this won't hold me back. When I retire I will have laid down foundations for volintary work - I will still have the need to be useful. I expect to be happy - cos what not to be happy about - I'm healthy, people who love me & a home that's mine
