			 I'm caring for the elderly, and also have helped my family to bring up my grandchildren. Although my life has been hard at times with money worries and lifes little ups and downs, on the whole I feel I've had a healthy and happy life watching my children grow up and get homes and children of their own If I had more time and money it would all be spent on or with them. They fulfil my life and it would have been a sadder place without them no matter how hard its been I have some good friends and are close to all my family. The work I do involves caring for others and this has made me feel valued.
