			 I HOPE WHEN I AM 60, I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE GOOD HEALTH, AND STILL HAVE ALL OF MY FAMILY AROUND ME. I WOULD LIKE TO BE ACTIVE, STILL BE ABLE TO SWIM AND GO FOR WALKS. I WOULD LIKE FOR MY HUSBAND AND I STILL TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER AS WE DO NOW - ALSO OUR CHILDREN ALL TO HAVE HAPPY & HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUT HAVING TO STRUGGLE IN LIFE. IT WOULD BE NICE TO STILL WORK PART TIME, AND ENJOY ANY WORK I CHOOSE. I LOVE WORKING IN THE HOSPITAL AT THE MOMENT. I WOULD LOVE TO CARRY ON UNTIL 60 YEARS OF AGE.
