			 My life at 60 - well I would like to be still working 2 days a week, the children I hope will be fit & well and maybe at univeristy and still living at home (even part time). I hope my husband's health + my health are still good and that we are leading an active life. It would be nice to think that we will have enough income for a comfortable life in the future, there are so many places to see. It's only 10 years away! PERSONAL
