			 I hope I will have changed jobs to something a little less physically demanding. I will definitely be working as I have no pension to provide for early retirement. I may be living on my own as my children will be in their late 20's by then. Health wise I already have creaky bones and expect this to get worse during the next 10 years. I don't expect my interests to change, gardening, reading, sewing, taking tea with my friends.
