			 I'm living in a solar-powered, water-harvesting straw bale or round earth house which I have designed and partially built myself. Outside is the community organic vegetable garden in which I share the work and produce with my community of friends. We live closely to permaculture principles. A few miles away is the beach and ocean. People are always visiting and sharing in how we live. I teach what I can of ethical, sustainable and environmentally positive living. I am a homeopath and engineer so am in demand as a fixer/ therapist to others or their machines. Life is full I like to write, take photos and be amongst my tribe. I'm fit, healthy and loved.
