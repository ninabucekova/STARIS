			 I am still working but on a part time basis. This allows me to enjoy time with my husband and family. I have several granchildren which I adore. I still enjoy jogging and have managed to get my husband interested in dancing which is helping to keep us fit. I am now helping out in a voluntary self help group. Life is great.
