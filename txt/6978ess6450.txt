			 AT THE AGE OF 60 I AM LOOKING TO LIVE A LIFE OF LITTLE STRESS, WORRY AND ALMOST FREE OF DEBT. I WISH TO BE TOTALLY OUT OF THE 'RAT RACE' AS I FEEL I HAVE NEVER SUITED SUCH A LIFE. I WISH TO BE MARRIED TO MY PARTNER - HOPEFULLY HAVE A CHILD BY THEN, BUT WILL BE VERY HAPPY AS JUST THE TWO OF US. WORKWISE I WOULD LIKE A PART TIME POSITION OUT OF INTEREST ONLY AND NOT TO TAKE IT AS TO RELY ON A WAGE. SO IN GENERAL, BY THE AGE OF 60 I WISH MY LIFE TO BE AS WORRY FREE AND EASY LIVING AS POSSIBLE. HEARTWISE - TO BE AS HEALTHY AS MY BODY WILL LET ME.
