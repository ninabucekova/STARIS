			 I like the job I have and hope to stay as I am work wise until I retire. hopefully all the house extension & modernising will be done, golf will be a part of my weekends rather than when I have time, health wise I hope I am as able then as I am now. although I do suffer with bad knees & back but not to a point of it stopping me doing things in general.
