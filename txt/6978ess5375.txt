			 Probably doing part-time teaching & maybe some music lessons. Expect my eldest daughter will not be at home although my 9 & 11yr old will still be dependent - university? I hope my husband & I will still be fit and healthy and taking part in physical exercise. I would like to be able to afford short breaks abroad & to have holidays & days out. I envisage we will still be involved in church. We will probably still live in same house.
