			 I am now retired. I do some voluntary work for childrens charity and plan to shortly do some volunteer work abroad with babies/young children. I have grandchildren that I take an active part in their life. I spend a lot of time travelling abroad and visiting my holiday home abroad. I go to college part time to learn new interests and visit the gym regularly to keep fit and active. I live with my partner but am happy to spend time by myself and visiting friends. I am still healthy though suffer a bit with my joints.
