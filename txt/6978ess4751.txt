			 Now I am 60 I am looking forward to my retirement at 65 ensuring that I am financially OK and stable. I have moved to a more rural environment with my partner. My health is not a problem to living an enjoyable life. My friend & family still visit and my stepson is employed in a stable job and his partner is in the same position and hopefully children are on the horizon.
