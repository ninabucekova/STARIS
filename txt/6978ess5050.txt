			 When I am 60 I will retire. I hope and expect to remain in good health. I will spend most of my time with my husband, and if finances allow (dependent on market stability) we will travel, perhaps spending 6-8 weeks/in another country in order to learn about other cultures. I will still be occupied by concerns about my sons, but hopefully they will be reasonably settled by then. I would like to be spending one or two days a week in voluntary work perhaps with young adults / parents. We will probably still be living in the same house - unless an unforseen deterioration in health makes managing the garden impossible. I will be reading and playing my violin in UNCLEAR.
