			 I will still be working full-time (unless my lottery numbers have come up!) I will hopefully still be healthy, although I expect I will have 'slowed down' a bit.

I hope to have been able to move closer to my sister, geographically. I would like to be feeling more financially secure. I will be looking forwad to your next round of surveys - I've loved being a part of the NCDS!
