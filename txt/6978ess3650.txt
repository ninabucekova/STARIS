			 Today I start receiving my pension from the main job I did for 20 years but I'm still working part-time and will do so until I'm 65. My civil partner of the last 10 years and I are ok financially, probably thanks to our parents prudence over the years, and, unlike them, we have inherited and are enjoying some travel & small treats. Our health is still not bad, which is encouraging, considering the worries we had at 50 about whether we'd see 60 & probably unfounded as regards our genetic makeup but so was the point of suddenly being hit by our own mortality ! We don't have children but try to be involved with our nieces & nephews and their offspring. Hopefully, they value our contribution. Happy to be alive, to have some value still in society and, most of all, to be loved !
