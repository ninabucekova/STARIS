			 I will be still witnessing to neighbours as a Jehovah Witness and going to my meetings regularly it being the main activity in my life. Visiting friends and family & seeing my neices & nephews progress hopefully as Jehovahs Witness being well rounded in their outlook & personality. I hope I will be well enough to play golf at least once (week and enage in walking or similar exercise. Hoping my mind will be a bit more settled and able to cope with family things! I really hope that Gods Kingdom would of taken over this earth & I would be growing to perfection on a paradise earth, involving myself in teaching people about our God Jehovah and how to attain to his standards, also purifying the earth for mankind to live on in peace & happiness, helping to build houses for neighbours & ressurected ones & welcoming back many of these from the dead to the cleansed new earth. Teaching people about Jehovah Gods loving provision to all & working in harmony with our heavenly King Jesus Christ. This I hope to be a reality within the next 10 years & I try to live my life in accord with this to what degree I can. MATT 24: 14, Psa 37: 10, 11 Psa 83:18 all theses scriptures to be fulfilled Daniel 2:44
