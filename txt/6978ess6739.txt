			 I have been blissfully married to my wonderful wife for twenty years, and we now have more time to do things together, such as making music, walking our dogs, swimming, eating out and entertaining. Through my wife's successful banking and events management business, which I help out with, we make contributions to selected charities. I still work, but for less hours and with more flexibility than before. I am happier than at any time in my life.
