			 I have now been retired (no, not retired, I am now a gentleman of leisure, sounds much better) for five years now, and I don't think I've ever been fitter. I'm cycling two or three times a week, 60-70 miles at a time, plus holidays in Britain and abroad, so I'm covering about 10,000 miles a year! I'm also finding plenty of time to indulge my other hobbies and pastimes, including astronomy and building my own hi-fi equipment, amplifier and speakers mostly. I certainly don't have time to work for a living, something I always considered to be a mugs game anyway. Don't know why I didn't pack it in sooner.
