			 At 60 I will still have lots of hobbies and ways of keeping active even if they vary from the hobbies I have at present. I hope to have finished in employment and be able to spend time gardening and looking after my friends & family. I hope to be a grandparent. I hope to be living at the same address. I have ambitions to have time to walk one of Britain's long distance trails. I don't think at 60 that my health will be so bad as to inhibit me in any way.
