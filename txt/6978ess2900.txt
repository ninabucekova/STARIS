			 Unfortunately not being able to retire at 60 I am still working at the same company ({WORKPLACE}) as I was 10 years ago Now the children have grown up (daughter 27, son 23) and behaving themselves at last! I have a better relationship with my husband as the children have in the past caused a lot of conflict between us in the past My health & well being is a lot better now I am more relaxed and able to come and go as I please with not being tied down thinking of wether the rest of the family needs me here and now.
