			 By 60 I hope to be fully retired & able to enjoy more leisure activities with my husband. We plan to have a home abroad for winter & spend summers in the UK. We are both keeping fit & active now in preparation for retirement & by this age & with the work put in during our 50's we expect to be reaping the benefits and continue with a comfortable life style. We plan on doing a lot of walking. Our one worry now & I expect then will be whether given our anticipated extended life span whether our savings & investments will last for perhaps 30+ years to provide for a long old age.
