			 Hopefully I will have just retired. Still living in the same house but also with a holiday home of some sort either abroad or in the UK. Would like to do some extensive overseas travel. More time to do DIY, gardening, go for long walks and possibly join some clubs - eg wine, gardening. Hopefully, health no worse than now - I aim to keep doing a small amount of exercise to maintain general good health. Not aiming to do too much work, and only paid work if necessary to achieve my other objectives. I will by then have had enough of firm work commitments, having to follow a routine, and being answerable to superiors.
