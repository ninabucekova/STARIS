			 I THINK I WILL BE IN PRETTY MUCH THE SAME POSITION AS I AM AT 50. AT LEAST I HOPE 50. WITH THE SIZE OF MY MORTGAGE I WILL CERTAINLY STILL BE WORKING. LUCKILY FOR ME I VERY MUCH ENJOY MY JOB. I HOPE MY HOME LIFE STAYS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS WELL AS I HAVE A GREAT FAMILY (JUST BECOME A GRANDAD) AND ENJOY ALL ASPECTS OF FAMILY LIFE. AS FAR AS MY HEALTH IS CONCERNED I WILL KEEP MY FINGERS CROSSED.
