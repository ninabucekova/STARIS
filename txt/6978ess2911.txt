			 I am still at work because of the mortgage, but enjoy it less these days - school is not really a place for 60 year olds. My children are wonderful, & I see as much of them as possible, but am careful not to be a nuisance to them. {HUSBAND} wants to sell the house and move, & I am thinking about this - I don't really want to move before I retire. The house is important to me as long as we live in this area. But in a few years time, I would like to be back beside the sea. We travel a lot, & there are thousands of places I want to see. Keeping fit & active is important to me. I have the idea of being unable to move, be independent.
