			 OUR MORTGAGE IS NOW PAID AND WE FINALLY MANAGED TO EXTEND OUR HOME TO PROVIDE A 'DEN' FOR OUR DAUGHTERS, WHO ARE NOW 17 AND 15 YEARS OF AGE. OUR ELDEST DAUGHTER HAS STARTED STUDYING FOR 'A' LEVELS. WE HAVE GOT USED TO THE IDEA THEY WILL NOW STAY AT SCHOOL UNTIL AGE 18. I AM STILL WORKING, BUT NOW ENJOY PART-TIME AND CONSULTANCY WORK. WE DECIDED TO STAY IN THE SAME HOUSE AND I AM ABLE NOW TO ENJOY GARDENING AND GOLF, WHICH IN THE PAST I HAD LESS TIME TO DO. I AM STILL HAPPILY MARRIED AND WE HAVE JUST CELEBRATED OUR 33RD ANNIVERSARY. STILL GETTING A GREAT KICK OUT OF TRAVELLING ABROAD, ALTHOUGH 4 ADULT TICKETS NOW 'BREAK THE BANK', SO TO SPEAK. I AM STILL ENJOYING GOOD HEALTH, I HAVE A FEW MORE ACHES AND PAINS, BUT HAVING LOST A LITTLE WEIGHT AND EXERCISING MORE I FEEL ON TOP OF THE WORLD, AM HAPPY & ENJOYING LIFE WITH MY WIFE AND FAMILY. WE ARE STILL ENJOYING THE CHALLENGES RAISING A FAMILY BRINGS AND HAVE BEEN SAVING HARD TO SUPPORT OUR DAUGHTERS CONTINUING IN FULL TIME EDUCATION, UNTIL THE POTENTIAL TO GO TO UNIVERSITY.
