			 I am now retired and looking forward to spending more time with my wife and supporting her, with her illnesses. Hopefully I will not have had any episodes of depression (I suffer from manic-depression) and my condition is under control. This will allow me to spend time on:- walking gardening (showing) driving DIY reading I may do voluntary work and hopefully get more satisfaction out of it than my 'proper' job gave over the last 12 years.
