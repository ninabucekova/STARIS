			 I would like to be working part time, hopefully still at the library, have a few grandchildren that I could spoil & spend my spare time with. Hopefully my health will still allow me the occasional holiday in the Carribean and another in Europe (possibly every year without being to greedy). Also only working part time would give me more time with my husband when he finishes work, doing things we want to do for a change.
