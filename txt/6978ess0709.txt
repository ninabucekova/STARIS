			 I will still be working. I hope, in order to support my family, although I fully expect to be in a less rewarding, less well-paid occupation. My two sons will, I hope, be on the way to independence at 25 & 28 respectively. My daughter will be 15, so home life should be lively. Perhaps by then I will have some free time to devote to personal interests, eg writing, languages, and hopefully more free time to share activities with my wife. I hope to be in reasonable shape physically, and to have given up smoking.
