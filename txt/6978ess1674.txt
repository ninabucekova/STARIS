			 I am now working as a fulltime bookkeeper, after training when I was 50. I play regular golf with my husband, one of my few luxuries , as I still have three more years to pay my mortgage. I have 10 grand & step grand children & 3 step great grand children. My health will be declining, I may even be dead, as I'll older than my mother & nearly as old as my father when they died. Both of my sons will visit regularly.
