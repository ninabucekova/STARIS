			 I enjoy line dancing and going away for weekends to meet other line dancers and am fit enough to be able to. Our grandson comes for visits and we go and see him a lot, he brings a lot of pleasure into our lives and hopefully he will be closer to us in proximity. {HUSBAND} and I have travelled a lot & are looking forward to even more travel. Still working at {WORKPLACE} but now doing shorter hours.
