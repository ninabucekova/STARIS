			 I am content and happy. I have been with my partner ten years. Her Children may have children of their own and I can be part of their lives also. I have worked in my social work job for over 20 years and been qualified for just over 10 years. I will have resolved and healed from much of my childhood trauma and neglect, and will value who I have become, in many ways because of it. I will have sorted out my finances better and have less debt. I will enjoy spending time with my partner and friends and be planning some trips abroad. PERSONAL
