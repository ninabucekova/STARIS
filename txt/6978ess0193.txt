			 At sixty I would prefer to be not working. I hope to be visiting countries I have not seen and spend time helping and supporting my daughters and any future grandchildren. I envisage helping them with decorating, childcare etc as long as I am physically capable. I adore catering for and hosting large 'get togethers' for family and friends and would like to have more time to continue with this but mostly I wish for good health & security for my family.
