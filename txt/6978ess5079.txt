			 Had an enjoyable day at work, its good to keep the brain ticking over. After dinner tonight, I will be going with Phil to maybe see a film, it's been a while so should be fun. {SON} and {DAUGHTER} maybe coming over at the weekend. It will be good to see them again - I do miss them, although having our dog keeps us active and a good excuse for long walks although is never really needed! We are thinking of selling the house this year. The garden is very big and we really dont need all the space anymore - although {DAUGHTER} and {SON} I know will not be happy about that. We have been really well this year, fingers crossed it continues.
