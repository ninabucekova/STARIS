			 I am just about to retire. I am living by the Sea with my partner and relaxing and enjoying life. My children have both been to university and have good jobs. They visit me frequently. I like to be involved in the community and attend meetings with friends about spiritual matters, I am trying to relax and enjoy life more. My health is not as good as it was and I am still trying to lose weight to help with arthritis in my foot. I walk most days for at least half an hour.
