			 Still very fit for my age. Want to spend even more time with my family, which is OK because an employer isn't really going to tak me seriously about what I can contribute. I am able to do voluntary work giving me a reason to get out of bed and the opportunity to socialise. When I want to persue other interests, I can. Still pottering around the garden. Nice to be outdoors. Prefer to be in front one, I can watch life bustling on and chat to passers-bye.
