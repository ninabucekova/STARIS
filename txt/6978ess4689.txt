			 I am working as a nurse manager where I feel my experience is valued by younger staff. I have reduced my hours a little to allow more time for my children and grandchildren. I still enjoying visiting different places and taking walks. I like visiting the theatre and the cinema. I enjoy inviting the family around and cooking with the younger generation, teaching them the way my grandmother taught me. I now have time to attend a ballroom dance class but still enjoy going to football matches. I have a few aches pains but am too busy to pay them too much attention.
