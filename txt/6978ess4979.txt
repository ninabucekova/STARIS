			 I have had a progressive disability for forty eight years, in that time I have restrictive movement in my hands and legs and feet. I continue to persue my favouite hobby of carp fishing with my UNCLEAR. Due to my disabilites and being restricted in what work I can do, I have not had work for twenty eight years. My wife is my carer and looks after me well and being like this for this amount of time, she never complains, a true angel.
