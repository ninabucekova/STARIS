			 I AM STILL IN FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT. I DO THE GARDEN MOST WEEKS WHEN IT'S NOT RAINING I GO TO ASDA EVERY WEEK. I DO ALL MY OWN DIY. I HAVE A BAD BACK BUT CAN STILL DEAL WITH IT. I'VE HAD BACK PAIN FOR 45 YEARS. NOT SURE HOW THE PENSION WILL WORK OR HOW MUCH I WILL HAVE TO LIVE ON WHEN I RETIRE AFTER THE MESS THE FINANCIAL PEOPLE MADE OF WHAT PENSION PLAN I HAD. STILL WITH MY WONDERFUL WIFE, KIDS VISIT EVERY WEEK. SUNDAY ROASTS WITH THE GRANDKIDS. NOT A BAD LIFE. BUT ALWAYS COULD DO WITH A FEW MORE POUNDS IN THE BANK.
