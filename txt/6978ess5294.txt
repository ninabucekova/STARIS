			 I hope that I will still be in good health. If I am working, I hope that it will not be full time in a post of responsibility. At present I am an assistant headteacher in a large secondary school and it is a busy job. Part time or not at all would be nice! My 2 children will be 26 and 24 and I hope that I will be able to visit them and spend time with them. I hope that my partner will be working less, or not at all and that we will be able to follow our interests of walking, gardening and do some travelling - New Zealand, Iceland and Canada are on the list.
