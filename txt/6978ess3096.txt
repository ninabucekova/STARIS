			 I am enjoying my life. I have looked after myself and remained healthy and fit, so I can still enjoy holidays abroad, walking, swimming etc. I really enjoy spending time with my children, granchildren, stepson and all of my family. I need to take more time to care for my mother, but I am still working. I enjoy my job very much but have started to "step away" from high pressure situations and avoid stress more. I hope my mortgage is almost paid and I can perhaps reduce the hours I work. I am in a better financial situation than I have ever been in as my long term financial plans begin to be realised. I am happy today, as I have been my whole life. Life is what you make it !!
