			 Having moved to France and bought a Farm with land and numerous out-buildings, these have finally been converted into Gites and our business has taken off. Each morning I collect the eggs whilst my husband sorts out the two cows, sheep and goats. Then its in the kitchen making the fresh bread. the Grandchildren have just gone back after their months holiday and then the whole family will be back for Christmas and the New Year, there doesn't seem to be enough hours in the day to do all we want, but we have never been healthier and so relaxed. Life is very good.
