			 I hope I have good health and also have a reasonable enough pension to be able to go out socially & follow the things I want to do. I think I will live in a smaller house which is cheaper to run & less work & my children will be independent. I hope I don't live on my own and my husband is still alive but retired by then - both retired or I may have a parttime job.
