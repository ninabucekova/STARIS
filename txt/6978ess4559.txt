			 At the age of 60 years, I am looking forward to retirement, being debt free i.e.no mortgage. Spending more time with my family. Enjoying time at home, hoping to maintain my health as it has been. Have enjoyed actively taking a role in my grandchildrens lives. I enjoyed watching my football team win the champions league.
