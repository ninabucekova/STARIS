			 We are still in the same house. My husband is now retired, so our income is reduced. Our leisure time is spent mostly in or around the house and garden. We now make far more use of days out at National Trust properties, which we were always going to do years ago, but now there's more time, and less money for more expensive outings. My interests are still much the same, walking (now with our dog), doing puzzles (sudoku, etc.), cooking, reading and TV. We both go to the local theatre a bit more now that John hasn't got such an early start in the morning, and we make a point of not getting up so early now. I am happy, and content with my life, and am still doing some voluntary work, bot through the church, and with local young people. I am still, or have only recently given up, being a magistrate, something I first considered about 10 years ago. Health-wise, I'm ok, not very fit, but apart form the odd ache and pain, I'm fine. Just aware of getting older!
