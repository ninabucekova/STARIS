			 At 60 I am still working although not as long hours. My daughter, {DAUGHTER1}, now 24, has moved away from home although {DAUGHTER2} 21 is still here. No more early mornings and late evenings rushing around taking the children to their sporting activities. More time to relax and enjoy a normal day. Not as stressed as at 50 - a bit more time for myself. Still enjoy travelling and holidays abroad. Trying to look after myself more and I feel better for it.
