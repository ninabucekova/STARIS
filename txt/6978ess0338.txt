			 I have tried to look after my health so I can do the activities I enjoy - walking, golf, swimming & gardening. With more free time I am spending doing things with my husband such as walking, holidays & days out, and also having holidays with my friends, like golf holidays & walking holidays. I still spend time with my daughter discussing books going to the pictures & cooking together. I have kept up with technology and use the computer for a variety of activities ie, email photos & pictures etc.
