			 I will still have to work, as since my divorce, my mortgage is not finished till 67! I will have to work full time, rather than part time and so will have a lot less time to pursue my interests - I teach, so have little home time with marking & preparation. I have 2 prolapsed discs in my back, so I expect these to get worse. As I am very sporty, this will be a huge blow. All my children will have left home and if I still havent met anyone, I can see quite a lonely life. Most of my friends here have plans to move out of the S.E to cheaper areas. As a single parent - money is always a worry and an issue. Having to make all the decisions single handedly also increases stress levels.
