			 I am physically well & looking forward to retirement - using the opportunity to travel, do sport, see friends more often, learn a language & do some voluntary work. Work will be part time/done on a freelance basis to fit in with other interests. I still live with {HUSBAND} and we have more time to enjoy ourselves. I see my twin sister every day.
