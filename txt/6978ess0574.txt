			 I am now quite a famous author. My writings deliver reasonable salary meaning I don't have to really work or retire. I am spending my time 50% writing and 50% helping young authors - which includes helping people with PTSD through getting them to be creative. My wife has retired too and we spend 3 months of every year in Southern France. I have never been healthier or happier.
