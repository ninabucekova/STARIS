			 I am retired from work with an occupational pension and I am living in Spain. My health is quite good and I have a lot of interests such as learning the Spanish language, gardening, walking, sightseeing and spending time with friends & family. I enjoy swimming both in my pool & down at the beach. I go out for a meal a couple of times a week and I do little bits of ad-hoc work or voluntary work. I am still married to the same husband and we share similar pastimes and goals.
