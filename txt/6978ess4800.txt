			 I hope to have more interests outside the home & family life as my children leave home & continue their lives. I hope to have a more interesting & fulfilling job. I hope that my husband & I continue to enjoy good health & a good social life with plenty of travel & that we are no worse off financially. Hopefully his job will become less stressful but remain interesting for him.
