			 MY life at 60 would be the same as it is now if I am still at the same job and place of work. I would still be fishing and going out and doing what I wanted to do. I would either be healthier and fitter with my excess weight off or still trying to loose it. I may also take a early Pension and retire at 60. and either emigrated or moved somewhere else. But I also think 60 is only a number that people live by ie 18-21 40 are all numbers and Birthdays people aim to achieve while people think 60-65 mean old age, pension and retirement, but really it should be the time to wind down and do what you want and enjoy yourself, if you are healthy & wealthy enough to do it.
