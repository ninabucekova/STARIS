			 I would like to be in full-time employment - possibly where I am currently working, in a slightly more senior role. I would like not to have any more money worries, but I do not need to be rich. I would like to be in regular contact with my brother and his family. I would like for my former partner to be in a much better situation than he is at present. I would like to be at least as physically fit as I am now. I would like to be more fulfilled in my personal life than I am currently. I would like to be a little more active socially - to go out and about a bit more. I would also like to be a little more involved in the life of the Synagogue I attend.
