			 I am in good health enjoying life & my family and Grandchildren. Still working to pay bills & do leisure activities, pay for holidays. Its a bit easier now we don't have a mortage to pay. Still being shafted by politics & world activities of both past & present. Worked since leaving school & still paying for lazy spongers. Criminals still getting away lightly due to soft do gooders. Time to do a bit of photography. Home life good children all ok & doing well.
