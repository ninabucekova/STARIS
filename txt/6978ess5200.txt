			 I'm frustrated that I'm ageing because appearance and fitness have been important to me. I'm very proud of the family I've raised - I see that as my greatest achievement. I hope I'm still married as I wouldn't like to live alone. I regret, more than ever, that I've been a smoker since I was 14, I have no intention of giving up now but wish I'd never started. With my increased wisdom I feel very opinionated and often say "I wish I knew then what I know now"! I've fulfilled my dream of living a bohemian life in rural France - back to nature & basking in the love of my family. I don't want to get old and I have a 'living will' so I'm not resussatated.
