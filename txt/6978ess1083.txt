			 I imagine I will still be working, full time with my current employer. I will still be married to my present husband although we will have moved to a smaller house. I hope to have set up my own business, making and selling cards / scrapbook pages. I would do this in my spare time and for my pleasure. Not having had any children, I am sure that I will still have 2 dogs as pets - even if it means having young puppies again!!! I will not be rich, but would hope to be financially better off than at present. However, if I win the lottery, then none of the above will be true as I will have given up my job and emigrated abroad!!!
