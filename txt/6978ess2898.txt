			 I'D LIKE TO BE LIVING IN {REGION East England} NEAR LAND WE PURCHASED SEVERAL YEARS AGO, AND WOULD LIKE TO RUN IT AS A SMALL HOLDING WITH SMALL AMOUNT OF LIVESTOCK AND GROWING FRUIT & VEGETABLES. I HOPE MY CHILDREN WILL BE SETTLED IN THE CAREERS THEY HAVE CHOSEN. MY MORTGAGE PAYED OFF. AND MY HEALTH WILL PERMIT ME TO CARRY ON ENJOYING AN ACTIVE OUTDOOR LIFE. NOT HAVE TO BE WORKING FOR SOMEONE UNTIL I RETIRE. AND STILL HOPE TO KEEP MY INTEREST IN TRAINS THAT HAVE MEANT A LOT TO ME THROUGH MY LIFE SO FAR.
