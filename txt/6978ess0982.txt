			 I will be living in New Zealand with my partner/husband. Still working as a counsellor part time but spending much time outdoors on the land we own - looking after animals of all types - mostly rescued. My health will be exellent as usual. My partner will be making sought after original pieces of furniture/ artwork which will allow us to live a comfortable life style - going overseas to explore new places + visit family friends, at least once a year. I will have close community ties + enjoy time with neighbours.
