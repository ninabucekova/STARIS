			 I hope that I have found short cuts to deal with crippling workload as the older I get the harder it becomes and life never gets easier. I hope I can stay active - continue to play both tennis and perhaps cricket till i'm 60. I hope I am active enough to still be able to climb a ladder etc and do a number of jobs for myself. I hope my mind is still active - good memory - v important and being able to visit family whenever I want - mobility v important.
