			 I am working a few hours per week. My health is good. I have a dog and my husband and I like to go away often with our touring caravan. We also spend a lot of time looking after our grandchildren. I still enjoy reading, doing a bit of sewing and really love doing my gardening and also baking and cooking. I am still doing telephone triage at the surgery but have expanded the generic role I used to have.
