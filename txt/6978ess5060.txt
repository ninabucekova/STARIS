			 Our children have grown up and are at opposite ends of their university careers; our son has just finished his degree, our daughter just about to start. Education sector continues to change with influences from political parties and various reviews but keeps me gainfully employed with the company I have now worked for nearly 25 years. I still enjoy playing golf although my hadicap seems to have suffered due to not playing as much as due to bad weather and family commitments. We have lived in this house for 15 years and still have no intention of moving.
