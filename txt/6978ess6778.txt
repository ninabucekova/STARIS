			 I expect I will still be playing tennis, organising the club and being a member of the Sports Club Management Committee. I hope to be healthy and active enough to keep up with my daughter and accompany my wife to dances, concerts etc. I expect I will still be working, though perhaps not full time. I hope to have more time for travelling, meeting friends and pursuing my hobbies, perhaps learning a new language. I hope to have helped my wife improve the house and to have more time to ourselves.
