			 I am fit, healthy slightly mischevious 60 year old woman who doesn't look her age - I'm still working with people and helping them to be happier + more fulfilled in their lives. I enjoy being part of the community and feel very content with my lot. I am surrounded by people who love me and play an active role within various community based organisations. I organise events that bring people together from all walks of life & from all over the world - I still have adventures and enjoy yoga, cycling, dancing + socialising. Life has never felt better. Oh and I'll have a gorgeous loyal, lover, friend , partner to share it all with!
