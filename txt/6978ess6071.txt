			 I am retired and now able to spend more time taking part in community activities. I enjoy my garden and walking in the local area. My husband and I enjoy foreign holidays and also visit friends and family in various parts of the UK. I am still in good health and although now living on a pension, I hope that we will be able to manage financially without me having to return to paid employment.
