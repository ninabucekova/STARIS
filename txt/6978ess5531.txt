			 I HOPE LIFE WOULD BE A LITTLE EASIER WITH NO MORTGAGE TO PAY, STILL PLAYING A ROUND OF GOLF, ON GOOD WEATHER DAYS & SURFING I HOPE MY HEALTH WILL BE STILL WITH ME TO ENJOY WORK AND HOME LIFE. PERHAPS TO HAVE MORE GRANDCHILDREN TO MAKE ME BUSY AND HAPPY, TO KEEP FEELING YOUNGER THAN SIXTY. TO LOVE AND BE LOVED BY MY WIFE & FAMILY, TO MAKE THE MOST OF EVERYDAY, TO HAVE FUN, TRY NOT TO WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT ANYTHING.
