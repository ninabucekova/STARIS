			 I am still married, I will be celebrating my 37th wedding anniversary! My two elder daughters will have married and have had children. My youngest daughter will have finished university and be wondering what she wants to do with the rest of her life. I will be healthy & out of the dreaded menopause. I will be travelling much more and with my husband. I hope I will be living in UNCLEAR again in the countryside in a home where there is plenty of room for family to visit. I hope my husbands health will be good and that the two of us will be UNCLEAR along nicely!
