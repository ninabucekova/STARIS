			 My future has very recently changed having just lost my mother. Its hard to see beyond the next day at the moment! I would like to think my health in relation to my diabetes remains the same. As my partner is poorly at the moment I cannot say where I would be at 60 - hopefully still with him. My two neices will be married and have their own children who I would be heavily involved with I'm sure. My aunt will be 93 and still living at home in reasonable health. Our two cats would be getting old but, no doubt still carrying on the same as now - just slower. I would still be working - probably part time whether I would be working as a project leader for HBOS - no one can say!
