			 My few words on reaching three score years. Firstly I would not want to tempt fate & presume I shall live that long. As I sit here in my lorry cab writing this on Sunday 2.15pm hopefully doing something similar which would be a good sign. For the above to have happened my DNA would have held out I would avoided serious injury & my life style wouldn't have ended my life. On these happy words I wish you well, keep up the good work.
