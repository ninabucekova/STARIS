			 I am very content in my home & have had a very good marriage for 33 years. My children have all flown the nest and are in general very happy. I am not very confident anymore I believe this is due to my age & arthritis which some days cripples me. I love to go to work I get satisfaction that I have done a good job and feel needed. I absolutely adore my labradors and nothing gives me more pleasure than walking with them in the woods. Yes, we all have sad times to reflect on but family love outweighs everything.
