			 I would like to think that my husband and I are fit and healthy - that we are still together. That our children are healthy and happy and are successful. I would like to think we are debt free and able to travel and we are financially secure. I would love to think that our daughters are able to care for themselves and possibly married and thinking or having children. Being together as a family is what I live for.
