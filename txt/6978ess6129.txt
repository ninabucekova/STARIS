			 At 60 I expect to have given up paid work but found some regular activity, perhaps voluntary work, to do each week. I would also hope to have developed some interests that bring me into regular contact with people each week e.g belonging to a walking group, an evening class. I would hope to have stayed reasonably fit enough to walk regularly and go away on active holidays. In 10 yrs I would expect my children to have married or be living with a partner and perhaps have their own family. I may be looking after elderly parents too by that time.
