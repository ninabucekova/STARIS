			 At age 60 I am in good health, limited occasionally by a back injury from 10 years ago. I lead an active life, enjoying walks on {PLACE South West England} and attending weekly dance classes and social events with my husband. I spend time caring for my grandchildren while their parents work. I work part time 2 or 3 mornings a week and do regular voluntary work at the local National Trust property. I have regular holidays both home and abroad using time share points I have owned for 20 years or more, especially enjoying winter sun and regular cruising.
