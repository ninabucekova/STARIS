			 Still enjoying keeping fit - perhaps still teaching the odd class. Continuing part time work for enjoyment - perhaps a few less hours. Enjoying time out with my husband who will also be retired/semi retired. Finally got round to learning how to play golf! Enjoying a few rounds with {HUSBAND}. Still love driving my MG! Still enjoy at least two holidays abroad & one holiday in UK every year. Still enjoying entertaining friends & visting friends & family who live away. Not much different to now really.
