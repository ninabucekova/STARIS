			 I AM LIVING IN MY DREAM COTTAGE AND HAVE A LOVING FAMILY AND A LARGE CIRCLE OF FRIENDS. I AM ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN MY FAVOURITE HOBBIES AND HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO FEEL COMFORTABLE BUT NOT AFFLUENT. I CAN GO ON HOLIDAYS AND MANAGE TO SAVE A LITTLE FOR A RAINY DAY. I AM STILL WORKING AS I HAVE A MORTGAGE TO PAY UNTIL I AM 70, BUT ENJOYING MY JOB AND AM PASSING ON MY SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE TO OTHERS. I HAVE A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH A WONDERFUL MAN ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT LIVE TOGETHER. I REMAIN FAIRLY FIT AND HEALTHY AND TAKE REGULAR EXERCISE. I CONTINUE TO DO MY VOLUNTARY WORK AND SUPPORT SEVERAL CHARITIES.
