			 I still live at the same address. I enjoy keeping fit, reading, going to the theatre, I enjoy holidays and spending time with my grandchildren, who still live close. My son is now married and my youngest child is working. I am in good health and take care of myself. My husband is retired and like to spend time in our house in Ireland. I visit the house regularly but prefer to live here long term. I still work but not at {WORKPLACE}. I love travelling and meeting new people and consider myself a very lucky person on the whole.
