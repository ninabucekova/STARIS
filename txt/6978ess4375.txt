			 Feeling tired, still working but should retire in 5 years if I can afford to, I probably won't be able to afford to retire at 65 though! Home is comfortable but nothing in it is expensive, I worry I will be healthy enough to carry on working past 65, I will still drive trucks then if they (governement) will let me. I have to have a medical every year to show I am fit enough to carry on driving past 60 years. It will get physically harder to work each year for me past 60 years as my job involves lifting & pulling weight!
