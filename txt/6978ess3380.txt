			 SINCE I BOUGHT MY FIRST SAMOYED DOG IN 1983 I HAVE STUDIED THE SAMOYED BREED PEDIGREE AND CHAMIONSHIP DOG SHOW RESULTS. I HOPE TO CONTINUE WITH THIS AS LONG AS I POSSIBLE CAN. I STILL OWN TWO SAMOYED DOGS. I AM STILL MARRIED TO THE MAN I MARRIED IN 1976. MY HEALTH HAS NOT GOT ANY BETTER. WE HAVE NOT GOT A LOT OF MONEY. WE STILL HAVE AN ALLOTMENT WHERE WE GROW OUR OWN VEG AND FLOWERS AND TAKE THE DOGS THERE AND HAVE A LAUGH. I ENJOY THE COMPANY OF MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS.
