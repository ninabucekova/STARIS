			 I am living in {COUNTRY, Europe} in my home in the country with my partner & pets. Doing a variety of things to provide some income, interest & pleasure. Reflexology, gardening, golf, teaching, dance. My depression will be lifted by the sun. I will be enjoying the company of friends out there - entertaining family when they visit. Exploring the country. I will walk more & be fitter & lose some weight. The use of the pool will help with that. This lifestyle relaxes me.
