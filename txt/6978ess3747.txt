			 I will still be working. I intend to retire at 65. My life will be as, if not more fulfilling than it is now. My work is very important to me & I will have become accomplished & expert within my own field, having worked on and developed my own skills. My personal life will be settled & I will still be as 'in love' with my soulmate as I am now, & he with me. My children will still be central to my life & I am desirous that they are happy & fulfilled in their chosen careers & personal lives. I suspect my son (a biologist) will be living abroad & my daughter (now doing a midwifery degree) will also be living away. I hope I see them regularly as they mean 'the world' to me. I will still be jogging & running for exercise & be enjoying the good health I am doing now. I will be busy. I like being busy, although for leisure travel & classical music & reading will prevail. I will still have a strong Christian Faith.
