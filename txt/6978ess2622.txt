			 I am working in a fulfilling job that I get paid for. I would like to be helping others & to be recognised for the autistic work that I can do. My children will have been through university, have good relationships & be happy and have jobs. I would like the freedom to travel & to be in a position to support my children when they have their own families. Hopefully I will be in good health & happy, and have many good friends.
