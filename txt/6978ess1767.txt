			 I would hope to be retired, living wether where I am or in a village location with my wife. I would like to be able to travel with a couple of overseas holidays per year, & do plenty of walking/trekking. I hope that my health stays reasonable. If necessary I would be happy to work part time in a DIY store or similar employment. I would also like to continue with my pastimes of gardening & hope to enjoy photography as a hobby rather than as the way I earnt a living.
