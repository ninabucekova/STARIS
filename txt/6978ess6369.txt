			 As a nurse, I would hope to be retired with a pension from the NHS. I may work a few shifts a month, depending on my health (nursing). I would like to be living in the same house with my husband, where we would have hobbies - gardening, travelling and would see family regularly. It is difficult to know how my health will be, but I hope to be healthy as I am now.
