			 I will still be working - probably still Full time - and still enjoying my work and Feeling it enriches my life. My children will now be 31 & 29 - I do not expect to be a grandparent yet but hope they are settled in relationships. We will still be very close - even if they live in other parts of the country/world we will maintain our relationship through emails/phone calls/visits etc. My mum will now be 87 & probably still living alone & active but needing much more support From myself & the Family generally. I would like to be more involved with some community or voluntary group - putting something back! I would only remarry with my childrens blessing as they mature into relationships themselves their tolerance & understanding will deepen.
