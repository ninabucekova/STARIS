			 I AM 60 NOW & LUCKILY HAVE GOOD HEALTH DESPITE CONTINUING TO LIVE WITH COELIAC DISEASE. I HAVE MANAGED TO GET MY WEIGHT BACK DOWN TO A TRIM 14 1/2 STONE AND NO LONGER HAVE BACK PAINS. I MANAGED TO LAND A GREAT JOB ON MOVIE MAKING, DIRECTING & EDITING SO FINANCES ARE BETTER NOW. WE HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM LONDON AND HAVE A LOVELY HOME & SOME GARDEN SPACE NOT FAR FROM THE SEA WHICH IS GREAT. WE ENJOY THE AREA AND THE NEIGHBOURS ARE GREAT FUN WHICH IS A BONUS. NEXT YEAR WE PLAN TO BUY A SECOND HOME IN UNCLEAR WHICH WOULD BE A DREAM COME TRUE.
