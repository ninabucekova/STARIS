			 I have Rhumatoid ARTHRITIS and this has restricted me from doing a lot of Physical Activitie's. I love being with my Grandchildren and my children, we laugh and have lots of fun. My family are eveything to me. I go on caravan holidays around the UK with my husband and we enjoy our time away from home but love getting back to see family member's.
