			 My lovely wife and I are living in the bungalow we always wanted. Our kids and their kids are regular visitors. We have meals out 1/2 times a week. I take part in discussion groups around future learning disability legislation. We have friends around weekly and my/our parents are still doddering on. Our youngest's dance school is thriving and Val helps with that. Life is good even though my health is not. I know it will deteriorate but we will keep it well managed and life will be lived around it and lived well!!
