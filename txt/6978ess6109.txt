			 I may be retired, or certainly thinking about it. If I'm still working, I'd envisage being in the same sort of office job that I currently have. (Whether I'm working or not would be dependent on the amount of money I had to live on). I imagine my health would be good still, I'd hopeully still be with my partner & have elderly parents that I would see frequently (+ other family members) I would spend a fair amount of the time gardening & walking in the countryside, going to the theatre, seeing bands, going out for meals & visiting country houses / gardens (National Trust etc). I don't imagine my life to be very different to now.
