			 I have a little cottage down a quiet lane with my wife. We spend some of the year in the UK and some abroad. We see our children a lot along with our grandchildren. The grandchildren come and stay sometimes at weekends. We have a quiet relaxed home life. Our children are both happily married & very settled. My health is generally good although the bones are starting to creak abit . My health does not prevent me doing anything. I like to relax by walking and try to keep active. I generally have very little stress in my life. In my spare time I would like to do some voluntary work on a regular basis. I'm still doing DIY to keep active. I'd like to be doing something to keep my brain active maybe dabble in stock & shares. What are the chances of all this happening???
