			 I write this after 4 weeks unemployment, so I hope I am working in a fulfilling job paying a salary that allows me to save for retirement, but also increase my social activities. My big hope is that both of my children have successfully completed their university courses & are in full time employment with reasonable success so far in their careers. The health of my wife & I are important, I would expect to be able to visit a health club a few times a week to allow us both to be active in other areas, e.g holidays etc. We may be grandparents so being physically able to assist would give great joy as well as a benefit to our children.
