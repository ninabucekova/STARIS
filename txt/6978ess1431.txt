			 I finally moved from  {PLACE1 East Midlands England} to {PLACE2 East England}  to move in with my long term man friend. We have a mortgage on a small bed and breakfast and have space for my family and old friends to come and stay. My partner/husband has retired but still does the odd painting and decorating to help our finances. I have time for my gardening, walking and reading, I also have a re-kindled interest in cooking. I have a large circle of friends here because I'd been visiting the area to see my partner for several years prior to moving here. OR My son has finally moved out and into a place of his own. My mortgage is paid off and I have a little money saved. I am only working part-time allowing me time for gardening, walking, reading and visiting family and friends. My parents are in their eighties and need more support but I can share the responsibility around our large family. I had the holiday of a life-time 5 years ago visiting Canada for a month. Holidays a broad I've never been bothered with, but I am loving working my way round the coast line of Great Britain. I don't know if I will like living on my own!?
