			 After taking up cycling again when I was 50 I have lost the weight I put on in my forties. I now go out every Sunday with the local cycle club. I managed to update my Engineering skills in my 50s and was able to continue obtaining contracts and have been able to clear my mortgage. I am looking forward to being able to retire in the near future.
