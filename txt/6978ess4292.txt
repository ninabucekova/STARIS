			 I am now semi-retired and enjoying more leisure time. I am able to work within my local community on a volunteer manned trasport scheme for those who cannot get out and about by themselves and I also help out in a local charity shop. I can also spend time on my painting and craft hobbies as well as growing my own vegetables in my garden. On the health front, since my treatment for cancer when I was 50 years old, I have had regular screening check-ups and my cancer remains in remission. I try to live a healthy and active lifestyle through eating wholesome food and walking & swimming regularly. I also still enjoy travelling and there are many cultures + countries that I wish to experience whilst I still can!
