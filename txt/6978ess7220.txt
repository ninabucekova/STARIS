			 Hopefully, I'll still be fit enough to play tennis, enjoy walking, swimming, cycling & gardening. I hope to have found a partner to share my life with. I shall be working part-time in my present job. I'll be involved in music - perhaps playing the organ in church, still singing in a choir, perhaps having learned to play the bass guitar. My daughter will have moved out but hopefully I will see her frequently.
