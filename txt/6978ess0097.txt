			 I TAKE EVERY DAY AS IT COMES, MY HOBBY WHICH IS HORSES AND RIDING GIVES ME SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO. I AM NOT THAT HAPPY WITH MY HOME LIFE NOW ONLY HAVING MY HUSBAND AT HOME AS CHILDREN HAVE MOVED OUT. I DO NOT LOVE MY HUSBAND AND MISS HAVING SOMEONE TO LOVE. MY HEALTH IS GOOD BUT SOMETIMES FEEL VERY ALONE. I LOVE MY WORK WHICH I DO PART TIME AS A HORSE RIDING INSTRUCTOR.
