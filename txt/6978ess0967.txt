			 When I am 60, I am hoping to still be fit & healthy in a good happy marriage. Eating out and going to the cinema are timeless passtimes that I intend to contine for a long time. Although my family is my life and I love to see them as often as I can, I would like to see my daughter move out & be independant. I would like to be in work at 60 as I like the social & companionship of being in the work place.
