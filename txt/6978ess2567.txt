			 OK, so I'm now sixty! Assuming lady luck stays with me and I stay safe I hope to be pretty much in the same position as I am now, namely at fifty I'm happily married, healthy, free of debt, reasonably free of stress and worry, in a position to work when I want to then drop it to concentrate on my other interests when that suits me, etc etc. I can't see how I can't achieve this. Nevertheless I am concerned for the future. Global warming really scares me, as does the risk of terrorist outrage and it's consequences which could wipe out all the financial assetts we've accumulated. As an only child with aging parents I'm concerned about them too, and what I might have to do to support them. I also fear for the future and what it will bring for our two daughters who, educationally, should be capable of persuing a good career, but in what sort of world? I despise George Bush and his legacy.@However I want to remain as optimistic as I can. I'll continue, of course, The Across Wales Walk through which I've achieved things very important to me, namely the long-standing friendship and appreciation of many fine people, something vastly so important than Â£s to me. Living life to the full at sixty for me is not waiting until retirement by which time, well, who knows? PERSONAL ...and still both pleased and proud to be part of the NCDS...and with apologies for the spelling which, over fifty years, I've still not got right!
