			 "60" I can't believe it. The children have all left home and I now have grand-children to babysit. I still work part-time at the airport, it helps financially and stops me from becoming a couch-potato. I'm to glad I gave up smoking, I feel better and more energetic, I need to be, to take my Cocker Spaniel for long walks. I'm not too old to still enjoy my concerts and shows and like to keep my brain occupied with crosswords and reading. I still haven't met anyone since my divorce, but hope I will always have the love of my children.
