			 My husband & I retired to {COUNTRY Europe} 2 year ago. We live on a complex with a golf course, which I continue to play. I also keep a daily discipline of stretching to help keep my joints flexible and protect my back in order that I can enjoy my golf. My handicap is now 16. Reduced from 24 in the past 10 years. I often considered voluntary work but never did anything about it. Our cats are 10 years old & loved dearly by my husband & me. My father is a widower, aged 97 and lives in a home, once a month I take a flight to visit him. I hate living away from my family in the UK, and especially miss my grandchildren aged 4+2.
