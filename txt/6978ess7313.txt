			 At the age of 60, I would hope to be retired but still carrying out one or two days consultancy work a week. I would like to think that there would be time for a regular exercise routine and that my physical well being could be improved. My children will have found their own paths in life and be established, happy and fulfilled. I look forward to having more time to spend with {WIFE} my wife and visiting lots of places on our "to do" list together.
