			 I have retired from my professional career and am burying myself in activities around the home in {PLACE South West England}. These will range from cultivating vines (from which we make wine for personal consumption) to organising concerts in our barn. I would be playing the violin again and have resurrected my earlier research into composition on the computer. I would expect to be in good health, although going a little deaf and may have developed diabetes. My wife will be starting to lose her memory and will be increasingly dependent on me.
