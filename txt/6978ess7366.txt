			 At sixty years of age I am still married to my husband of thirty five years and looking forward to his retirement in two yearst time. We are planning our move to the area we have chosen to retire to and looking forward to taking longer holidays rather that the two single weeks we have made do with while he worked. I am still exercising regularly but now put more emphasis on yoga and gym work rather that road and hill running. I see my children and their families regularly and enjoy being involved in their lives.
