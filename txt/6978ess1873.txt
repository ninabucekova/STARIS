			 I HAVE BEEN RETIRED NOW FOR FIVE YEARS AND REALLY ENJOYING LIFE. THE BALANCE IS PERFECTLY SPLIT, KEEPNG FIT, PLAYING GOLF, SPENDING TIME WITH MY WIFE {WIFE} BOTH AT HOME AND ALSO TRAVELING. THE CHILDREN HAVE FINISHED UNIVERSITY. AND I AM ENJOYING GUILDING THEM THROUGH THE NEXT STAGE OF THEIR LIVES. I JUST LOVE SPENDING TIME AT HOME WITH FAMILY & FRIENDS, THE ONLY CONCERN I HAVE IS FOR THEIR FUTURE AND WHAT THE WORLD WILL BE LIKE WHEN THEY ARE 60?
