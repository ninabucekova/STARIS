			 AFTER 20 YEARS OF WORKING AWAY FROM HOME IT'S A GREAT FEELING TO BE RETIRED AT LAST AND BE ABLE TO SPEND QUALITY TIME WITH MY WIFE {WIFE}, TO BE ABLE TO DO WHAT WE WANT WHEN WE WANT TO. MY GENERAL FITNESS HAS IMPROVED SINCE BEING HOME BY BEING ABLE TO EXERCISE MORE AND TO EAT MORE HEALTHILY, OUR TWO HOLIDAYS A YEAR ARE NOW MORE ENJOYABLE KNOWING THAT WHEN WE RETURN HOME THE WILL BE NO RUSH TO RETURN TO WORK. HOPEFULLY MY GUITAR PLAYING WILL BE BETTER FOR THE EXTRA TIME I'M ABLE TO SPEND PRACTISING AND TO BE ABLE TO PLAY WITH THE BAND ON ANY NIGHT OF THE WEEK INSTEAD OF ONLY WEEKENDS.
