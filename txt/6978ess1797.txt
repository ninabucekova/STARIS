			 Hope to be healthy, retired, volunteering once a week or so in a local school. Hope to have my children living near enough to see regularly and hopefully grandchildren to enjoy - wouldn't mind helping out with childcare if children & partners are working. Want to study for enjoyment once career is over - possibly OU. Want to be interested in the world, open to new ideas and experiences. Want to be seeing friends and family regularly & able to enjoy leisure activities and travel.
