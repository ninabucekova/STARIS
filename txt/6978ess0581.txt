			 I'm 60 and enjoying the things I never ever did, or could not do when I was working. My health has deteriorated a little, but I hope to try and keep fit by walking in the Dales. I really do enjoy spending more time with my friends and family, and quality time seeing parts of the world I have not explored. I am proud of my son {SON1} who is doing well and greatful that I am able to spend more time with him in coaching him through his education. I look forward to another +20 years. I hope!
