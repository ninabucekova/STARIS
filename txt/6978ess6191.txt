			 Imagine: My life is much as it is now, working as a bookseller, partly at home and half the week away. I stay with my girlfriend in London every other week, an arrangement which has lasted. The photography I pursue outside work remains largely a self fulfilling pursuit. My mother in 2018 is 92 and is either just about ready to throw in the towel, or has just died. With her marbles and quite suddenly. My own health has been compromised by a weakened back. Not as fit as I should be, but I remain vital. Imagine: I have lost my job in the slump and, due to deteriorated health, have only managed to scuzz around in the black economy since. I am living in unpleasant circumstances. My girlfriends also ran out of work & returned to Japan. My mother has lost her marbles and all the residual family money has been sucked into cruel & exhorbitant 'care'. my photography is no longer possible. Imagine: I have won The lottery and now work full time at my photographay. I have somehow managed to fall in love & married. My mother, having decided in 2008 that she would last another 10 years, has changed her mind & wants to go on. With bags of money, this is not a problem to facilitate. My back has fully recovered & I live an active life, on & off water skis, up and down escalators.
