			 I imagine my life would be much as it is now. I will still be in the same house and still married to {HUSBAND}. Our grand-daughter would be 12 years old and imagine she will be a big part of our lives as she is now. We would take her on holidays and spend as much time with her as we do now, as she lives 5 miles away. I think our close friends would be the same as now. I do not feel I would be suffering from any illness, but one never knows. I like to think I would still be young at heart and able to move with the times. I will be looking forward to retirement but will work as long as I can in order to maintain our lifestyle. I love my home and will always keep it nice and the garden as well - I imagine I will still be as content with my life as I am now and get pleasure from the same things i.e. family, friends, home, holidays. I hope I will not become a grumpy old lady!
