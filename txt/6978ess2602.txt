			 THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT QUESTION. IS IT WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO BE DOING OR WILL PROBABLY BE DOING. THE LATTER IS COMPLETELY DOMINATED BY THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CLIMATE. THE RATE AT WHICH THE CURRENT DOOM & GLOOM IS NOW AT WOULD AFFECT ME QUITE CONSIDERABLY. MY HUSBAND BEING A CONVEYANCER (PROPERTY LAWYER) WHO IS EMPLOYED BY SOMEONE ELSE COULD LOOSE HIS JOB AT ANY MOMENT. THAT WOULD RESULT IN THE HOUSE BEING REPOSSESSSED AND AS THE HELP PEOPLE LIKE US ARE ACTUALLY GIVEN I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. WE HAVE NO CONTINGENCY PLANS SO LIKE MANY OTHERS I REALLY WOULD NEED A CRYSTAL BALL TO DETERMINE THIS ONE. I KNOW THIS HAS NOT BEEN VERY HELPFUL BUT IF I COULD BE 75% SURE OF WHERE I WOULD BE THEN PERHAPS THIS WOULD REFLECT ON SOME OF MY ANSWERS TO PREVIOUS QUESTIONS.
