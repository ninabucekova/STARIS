			 Still living in this house. My husband is younger than me so he would still be working but not so many hours as now. Both children happy in work and hopefully relationships. Would like them to be living in their own places instead of still at home. Fit enough to still go out walking with the dog on a daily basis. Take advantage of mid-week theatre/cinema offers to enable me to see more West End shows or films. Would be happy to have a few hours paid/or unpaid work in a hospital or hospice.@Hope to still be fit and healthy and enjoy going on holiday - still many places I would like to see.
