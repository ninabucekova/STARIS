			 I am happy and content. If I havent moved to the coast I visit regulary. I am living with my partner (is it {PARTNER}?) I have maintained my fitness and health with exercise and a good diet, I weigh under 11st. I am still a therapist but have learnt other disciplines that are not as physical as massage. I am good friends with my sons and visit regularly as they do to me. I have a dog.
