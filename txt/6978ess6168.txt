			 Full on, burning the candle at both ends, great home life, loads of friends, in rude good health, physically fit, (athletically fit), lively adult family. Children getting on with doing things they enjoy to a high standard & able to form good relationships. Marriage still exciting & pretty much perfect. In full time employment (or in full time work) working with imagination and commitment. Enjoy all London has to offer - theatre, film, restaurants, loads of people in a small are, good dinner parties. Cup very much half full NOT half empty. Still feeling in my late twenties and believing every day offers hope & opportunity.
