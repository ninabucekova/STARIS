			 I have moved down to {PLACE South West England} to be near my parents and sister. I am living in a 2 bedroomed house with my dog, the spare bedroom is used when my family and friends come to stay. I am working part-time so I am able to take long walks, enjoy my garden and read a lot. I am taking a pottery course and doing a fair amount of cooking. I have finally quit smoking and feel quite well in myself.
