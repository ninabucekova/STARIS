			 I would love to imagine that my kids would all be settled in jobs & leading their own lives. I hope to meet someone in the mext 10 years who I can retired with & enjoying life together in semi/retirement. That we could devote more time in our christian ministry & seeing this beautiful world that we live in. I cant see myself living in this house, maybe some thing smaller where we didn't have a mortgage. If I don't find a partner I aim to do this on my own & with friends. I may have a little job if I still need a suplement income but only part time. This is all hoping that time & health ravages hold up. - watch this space - The new system that I'm praying for may be here instead.
