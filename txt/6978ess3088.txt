			 I AM RE-MARRIED AFTER BEATING MS. MY FITNESS IS SUPERB AND I AM TOTALLY HAPPY. I HAVE LITTLE MONEY BUT PLENTY OF ENJOYABLE WORK TO DO IN AND AROUND MY HOME. WORK THAT IS SHARED AND ENJOYED BY MY PARTNER, WHOM I LOVE AND RESPECT. MY CHILDREN VISIT REGULARLY AND THEY MUCK-IN. I GO OFTEN TO THEIR HOMES AND HELP THEM OUT WITH ALL MANNER OF JOBS WITH MY WEALTH OF EXPERIENCE, MOSTLY JUST ADVISING, AND THEY APPRECIATE IT. I TAKE THEM OUT FOR MEALS AND MINI-BREAKS AND WE ALL HAVE GREAT FUN ADN ENJOY EACH OTHERS COMPANY AND LIFE BECAUSE IT'S SHORT AND WE MUST MAKE THE MOST OF IT.
