			 To project myseld forward to 60 years of age I would hope that my lifestyle would not have changed much providing my health remained good. I would still be carrying out the leisure pursuits I do now or would like to think I would have embarked on new projects as well. If I am still working I would like to move closer to my place of work, Maybe move away from city suburbs to a smaller closer knit community. If I'm not in paid employment I would take up some form of voluntary work.
