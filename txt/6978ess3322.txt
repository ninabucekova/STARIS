			 I'm in reasonably good health, especially since I now finally have the time to indulge my interests of walking and swimming on a regular basis. However I am constantly worried about the health of my partner and regretful that he is rarely able to share my interests due to his weight & diabetes. I am continuing to persue other interests such as piano, singing, voluntary work etc. My children have all grown up, married and begun to have children of their own, so my husband and I grab every opportunity to visit them, or help care for the grandchildren. My husband has now retired but I intend to work until at least 65. We are financially secure enough to enjoy some more foreign holidays! We see our friends more often now that our family commitments have eased.
