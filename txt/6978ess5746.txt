			 I am living with my husband, with a few close friends and members of my family nearby. We are both healthy and mobile and spend a good deal of time (living at our home in the countryside, lots of walking, gardening. I hope to be retired, but continuing to work in a voluntary basis (mabe a day or so a week). I hope to be able to afford to travel abroad - we may buy a camper van and take to the road! Looking forward to seeing my children develop and grow - (I may be a grandmother by then!) However, I am very aware that my life could take a very different turn. Both my father & father-in-law died in their mid-50's - my dad, very suddenly.
