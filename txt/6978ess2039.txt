			 At sixty I will be retired and spending the time doing the hobbies of gardening, DIY, country walks with the dog. Some of my time will be spent helping my brothers and sister, nephews and nieces in the gardens, and DIY in their homes. I hope to visit Australia and relatives over there for longer and travel around for several weeks/months in a camper van re-visiting places and visiting new places. It will allow me more time to re-ignite my talent for drawing and painting. I would like to research the family history in more detail. Will give me more time to spend in Church related activities and the Choir. I would love to learn to play the piano. Whilst I might be living alone the family (brothers, and sister) all live close by. God willing my health should be good and perhaps I may even take on a part time job, but one that is out in the fresh air.
