			 It's hard to believe that I am no 60 years old! Where has the time gone. I don't feel this old and people tell me I don't look it! I have managed to keep my weight at a farily steady level. Could do with losing a few pounds but then I've been saying that for years. I still try to play tennis at least 1-2 times a week, and also do some yoga. My two dogs also keep my active with daily walks. I am now living in {PLACE Scotland} and the business is going well. We opened a B&B 5 years ago. We have family nearby that helps out when we want to go away. I am still involved with helping adults with literacy on a volunteer basis as well as working with children & adults who do not have English as their first language. We still travel quite a lot and love to have family & friends come to stay. We made sure our house suits our lifestyle and has room to accomodate visitors. I finaly learned how to play the piano and have regular get togethers with others who also love music.
