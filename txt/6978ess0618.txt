			 Life is becoming increasingly difficult for us all, the state of the economy, employment, crime rate, housing. I can only say that, I along with many others as we approach retirement years, will still have the lacklustre lifestyle that, overtaxing & increased inflation relieves us of our cash quicker than we can earn it. So gone are the days when you had money left after paying the household priorities! We are constantly supressed by Government, and Dominated by political idiocrisies I am a firm believer of post code lottery, and where you live dictates your future, your health, wealth & lifestyles. Privatisation has destroyed this country, and that of the working class, who have more than paid for a healthier nation. I can only think back to my Mother and Father, & theirs also, having to pawn valuables, and household, to put a meal on the table, 50 years on, and it is no better, except the pawn brokers have gone, and the doorstop loan sharks replace them. I have no hobbies or much interests other then taking care of the home. My health, is poor with various medical conditions, I am at present trying to get back into a return to work programme, with the jobcentre I have not worked for over ten years with illnesses. My life could be better, I am disapointed I have not achieved more at my stage in life.
