			 At 60 years old, I am living a very lonely life, with very little contact with my family. I have suffered heart disease in the past few years, and possibly facing the prospect of cancer treatment. I am unable to work or go out at all because of nerves and other phobias. I have made nothing of myself in the past and feel I have nothing to contribute for the future.
