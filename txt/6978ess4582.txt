			 Well, assuming I'm still alive, my daughter is now 25 and still lives at home, her sttitude limits the things I can do and I am still here cooking, cleaning & washing for her and my partner who still likes to go away walking at weekends - I still can't drive, am limited in mobility & am on a very limited income, I have no family left much (ie cousins - they don't get in touch) and I avoid people as they seem nosey! Once a month I find the energy to go to a different town to shop which is a drain on money! Like my mother, who at 60 "lost her mind" I sometimes feel I am too loosing mine. I just hope I don't commit suicide at 61 like she did! I've spent my life trying not to be like her.
