			 I am retired and still happily married. Both my children have left university and are in good jobs. My life is now full of things I want to do - horseriding, walking, gardening, reading, travelling. I'm not worn out by the difficult, stressful job that I had when I was fifty. I don't have a lot of money, but enough - I don't need as much because the children have left home! I am relaxed, healthy and happy.
