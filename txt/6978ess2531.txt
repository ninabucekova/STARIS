			 My name is {N16365P}, I hope to be still living with my male partner. Having a very good life, travelling all around the world, doing some voluntary work for disabled or other less fortunate people. Have more time for my interests, such as stain glass making, hill walking - doing more things with my two daughters - and hopefully maybe a grandchild!!! I sincerly hope to be having a very good sex life!!! Can I just say that in this form there is no question on a person's sexual orientation, as from my personal and professional experience, peoples lives do change regarding their sexual orientation between the age of 35+. This may be, the person may feel more comfortable about coming OUT. Hope you don't mind me writing the above comment.
