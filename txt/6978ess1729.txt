			 I have retired from my current full time post and have started a new venture. I still play tennis and have found I enjoy voluntary work. I have several holidays each year travelling to different countries. I am now a grandfather and enjoy the time I spend seeing my grandchildren. I am reasonably financially secure - certainly in comparison to UNCLEAR now we have downsized our home. I take pleasure in the simple things I share with my loving partner. I enjoy making her and others around me happy.
