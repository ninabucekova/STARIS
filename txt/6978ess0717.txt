			 life is still looking good. I'm still working in my job as an Assement and reablement worker with social services. I think they will have to drag me from this job kicking and screaming. It still good to be at home with the family I love it when we are all together but I also enjoyed time alone with my husband. We still love our holidays 2 x a year if we can manage it. My health is pretty good still get a bit of jip from my back, an injury I got while working in homecare in 2007. I keep up the phiso though and it dosn't stop me doing much. My husband and I still love going to the theatre, walking in the country and along the beach. We are now thinking of downsizing on our property hopefully into a smaller bungalow.
