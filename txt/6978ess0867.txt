			 I hope to have retired from teaching but will need to do something to occupy my time - hopefully I'll be able to devote more time to my hobbies of cake decorating & flower arranging. My husband & I hope to spend quite a lot of time travelling, sometimes with our friends. We will also spend time with our three children & by then, a few grandchildren I expect! I hope my husband's health will have improved (or at least not got worse) & that the joint pains I'm experiencing are only symtematice of the menopause & not arthritis. I expect to still be living in this area, probably in the house. We'll have a good private income from investments - we hope!
