			 At 60 I hope to still enjoy my gardening, perhaps only for my pleasure, rather than as paid employment. I am active, able to enjoy keeping fit, being outside, walking dogs, spending time in the good weather. Hopefully I can still enjoy visiting France and will keep my love of the language. I want to be fit, clear of the menopause, not overweight. It would be good to be clear of the depression that has tainted my life for the last 10 years. I will still be growing in confidence as I know I still have much to learn. I still live in the village and hope to be not a "newcomer" by then. My husband will still have his wonderful mind but will probably have slowed down a little. My love of being with him still grows. My son has a fulfilling job in London and is still happy with his partner. I hope he is able to enjoy life without fear of discrimination. He is a happy man. My friends are still important, as is my sister, neice & step grand-daughter. I love seeing them!
