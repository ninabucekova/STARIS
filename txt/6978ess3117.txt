			 I hope to be in good health, perhaps still working but looking forward to the freedom of retirement. I hope to be married still with my son independent but perhaps still living at home. I hope to spend more time on travel and hobbies - taking courses and expanding my mind. I would like to go on walking holidays with my husband and do more non-child orientated activities. No more babysitting! I would like to walk the Cotswold Way and Hadrian's Wall. I would like more couple rather than family activities. I see myself still living here and teaching, with the same family set up. More great-nephews and nieces, I hope!
