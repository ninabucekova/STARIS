			 I'M 60, I'M STILL WORKING AND MY CHILDREN ARE ALL FINANCIALLY INDEPENDENT (BUT PAYING OFF STUDENT LOANS!). I MAY EVEN BE A GRANDMA (MIXED FEELINGS!). MY HUSBAND AND I ARE ALSO NOW FINANCIALLY INDEPENDENT, OUR MONEY IS OUR OWN - YES!! WE CAN GO HOLIDAYS ABROAD IF WE WANT TO, WE CAN AFFORD ALL THE THINGS WE COULDN'T AFFORD WHEN BRINGING UP OUR CHILDREN, ESPECIALLY PUTTING THEM THROUGH UNIVERSITY. WE'RE FIT AND HEALTHY AND RETIREMENT IS IN SIGHT. WE KNOW THAT WHEN WE DO RETIRE, WE WON'T HAVE AS MUCH MONEY, BUT WE HAVE NO DEBT. I MAY EVEN HAVE PUBLISHED MY NOVEL BY THEN AND WON THE MAN BOOKER PRIZE! I COULD THEN GIVE A BIT BACK, BUT I WILL ANYWAY, WHATEVER I CAN AFFORD. I'D LIKE TO HAVE ENOUGH SPARE CASH TO HELP CHARITIES/NOT FOR PROFIT WITH CORE FUNDING. I'LL TAKE MY HUSBAND TO {COUNTRY Africa} WHERE I LIVED AND WORKED FOR 2 1/2 YRS. I'LL NEED TO BE CAREFUL THOUGH, MY CHILDREN WILL BE ANNOYED IF I GIVE ALL MY MONEY TO GOOD CAUSES AND LEAVE NOTHING FOR THEM. (NOT ENOUGH SPACE!)
