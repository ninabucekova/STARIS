			 I will hopefully still be working maybe a few less hours. My health is still good as is that of my husband and family. Both my daughters have finished their further education and have good jobs they enjoy. I would still like to be part of the community I live in, perhaps help more in the voluntary sector when I can. I would also like to think I can start new hobbies sports etc to keep active and continue to make new friends.
