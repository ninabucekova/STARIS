			 As I am the mother of an autistic child my life will depend on what she is doing & where she is living. What I would like is for myself & my husband to be financially able to have a couple of holidays a year (on our own!) & to be able to go out for meals etc a couple of times a month. I dont think I will be very healthy unless my weight drops dramatically. I think I will still be living at the same address.
