			 Providing my eyes don't pack up & can still see myself striding out onto the cricket pitch, but under arm, to open batting for 2nd XI. Hopefully, my grandson or daughter will be there with family watching from the sidelines. I see myself working, supporting my beautiful wife, & seeing my children forging a life for themselves in their brave New World. My youngest will be 20, eldest 31 & two in between. My dog will be 10 yrs old by then &, like her master, take slow thoughtful walks together, just like a pair of OAP's, companiable in our own silence. Above all, I pray for continued good health with my mental facilities intact. See you in 10 yrs!
