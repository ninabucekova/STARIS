			 Have recently retired from work. Spending more time with my husband and family. Having time to do more at home, such as cooking more interesting meals & gardening. Spending periods of time at our house in France & speaking French better. Doing lots of walking and taking up interests I've not had chance to pursue over the past few years such as painting, Yoga, swimming etc. Possibly helping out in local school or some voluntary work. Hopefully still healthy.
