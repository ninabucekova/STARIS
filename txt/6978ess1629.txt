			 I am now retired from paid employment, however I do voluntary work at the local hospice and I also take care of my grandchildren on a regular basis. I enjoy being at home and my husband and I enjoy our weekends away together. I am totally organised at home now that we have downsized and I find keeping it that way easy now all the children have left home. I have joined a walking club and feel that this benefits my health as well as my social life! In fact I feel better now than I did ten years ago!
