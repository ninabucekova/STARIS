			 I HAD A HARD DAY AT WORK TODAY, THINGS ARE REALLY PICKING UP (HOPE THEY TAKE ON SOME EXTRA MEN SOON). CANT WAIT UNTIL THE WEEKEND SO THAT I CAN WATCH THAT FILM ON MY PROJECTOR. RANG MUM TODAY SHE SEEM OK, WILL GO OVER TOMORROW WITH HER SHOPPING/ETC. THESE NEW BLOOD PRESSURE TABLETS ARE REALLY GOOD THEY DON'T MAKE ME FEEL AS TIRED AS THE OLD ONES.
