			 Life at 60. A happy home life (God willing) with my husband nearing retirement. My daughter perhaps now away from home and preparing to marry. My 3 sons established with their own families - perhaps more grandchildren (I already have 1) My social life and worship based around my church which is still very important. Having time to enjoy the craft activities I like. Perhaps slowing down physically. However, our hope of Christs return to the earth and the Kingdom of God established may have come to pass by then!
