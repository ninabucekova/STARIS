			 I hope to be retired by the time I am 60 years old. Along with my husband I plan to travel to visit new parts of the world, as well as exploring further parts of this country by having caravanning holidays. I expect to be fit and healthy, and continuing to lead an active lifestyle through walking, cycling, swimming and ski-ing. I plan to spend as much time as possible enjoying the company of family and friends. As well as the above we are planning to carry out some voluntary work, looking for opportunities locally as well as being involved in projects overseas eg. with World Vision.
