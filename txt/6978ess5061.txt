			 I HOPE TO STILL BE NURSING, CARING & LOOKING AFTER PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY. I SHOULD IMAGINE I WILL HAVE GREAT GRANDCHILDREN. I WILL BE ENJOYING LIFE WITH MY FAMILY, HAVING RELAXING AND QUALITY TIME WITH THEM AND MY HUSBAND, BOTH AT HOME, GARDEN AND HOLIDAYS. I HOPE MY HEALTH IS STILL O.K AND THAT I AM HAPPY, EMOTIONALLY & MENTALLY.
