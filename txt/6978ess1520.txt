			 I imagine at 60 that I will still be working 3 or 4 days per week at my husbands business. I hope that I will have grandchildren and shall spend as much time as possible helping with their childcare and also being a positive influence on their lives and those of my adult children. I imagine visiting and looking after my parents too who I imagine will be now have health worries, (in particular my father). I imagine that I will have to watch my own health considerably as I get quite tired and suffer with asthma. I will try to walk and swim to aid my general wellbeing as I want to be fit enough to support the whole family as an active person. I hope to have more time to pursue hobbies such as my needlework/diy which I find relaxing and also more time to read. I hope to continue to enjoy my life with my husband, theatre & holidays.
