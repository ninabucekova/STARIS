			 I would be living in the same house in Birmingham. Planning to redecorate or move to a village. Not working but fostering children with disabilities spending more time cooking, decorating, gardening, knitting, cake decoration etc. More time to visit friends and family and inviting them back to stay or visit. Spend more time at the gym - swimming, body balance, yoga and horse riding. Also would get a dog and be able to take the dog for daily walks. Read more and plan more day trips and holidays.
