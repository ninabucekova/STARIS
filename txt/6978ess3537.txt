			 I imagine that at 60 my family and my faith will contrive to be very important to me. At this stage I expect that we will have several granchildren and would hope that all of our children will have settled down and found partners that they are happy with. Unfortunately I imagine that our parents will no longer be alive which is a sad thought. I hope to still be working for the same company as I have a very enjoyable job and two excellent bosses. I would also hope that my health will be good enough to still play table tennis and be a part of the club which I enjoy being a member of.
