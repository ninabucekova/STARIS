			 I've retired and have finally got round to playing golf. My wife and I enjoy travelling to those distant places we always promised ourselves we would. It's great to visit our children and to help them out with our young grandchildren. When at home we like to go out walking and I sometimes drive the community bus besides helping out at the UNCLEAR charity shop. I also still like to play 5-a-side on a Thursday night!
