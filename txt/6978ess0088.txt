			 I am with my husband in a camper van exploring Europe, staying a few days or weeks as we feel we want to stay. Maybe do this for a few months then go back, see the children and friends. Then set off again in another direction! When we've had enough of the exploring we will go somewhere where we can use our skills to help, not sure where whether in England or abroad. While back in England unlikely to be sitting in front of the tele very much - I'll find something to do!
