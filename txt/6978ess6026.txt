			 I am still in the same job doing the same thing I always have and looking forward to retirement. Due to deteriorating health and back problems, I am unable to persue many interests, or hobbies, and spend most of my time in front of the tv. Family life is much the same as always, with me and the wife living together but not much to say to each other, and the kids still, coming round only when they want to borrow something and the grandkids much the same. The economy is still struggling, with pensions being hit, and pensioners, after working all their life, being dumped on the scrap heap, with a low standard of living. It would be nice to retire and go to live abroad where older people are respected, and where the law still has control, and prison still worries people!
