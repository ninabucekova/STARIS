			 At age 60 hopefully I will be:- - living in a small but comfortable home with a loyal, loving husband, visited regularly by our grown-up children and grandchildren, - working part-time (a few hours a week) just to keep active and stimulated, and to afford the occasional nice holiday or special treat, - still going for long walks and taking some regular exercise, be reasonably fit and generally healthy, - still reading lots, going to see plays and films, gardening, interested in what's going on in the world, - seeing friends often, both as a couple and individually, and still be close to my sister, - be as contented, happy and cared for as I am now.
