			 The Bible contains promises that God will establish his Kingdom on earth (as mentioned in the Lord's Prayer) I hope it will happen within the next 10 years, so I hope life will be dramatically different then. I will be a farmer in a world rapidly improving in peace and environmental conditions. No more war or crimes. People's health will be improving. So I look forward to this with great confidence.
