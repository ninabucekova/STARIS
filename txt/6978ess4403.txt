			 I will still be working in Safety assessment, although less in engineering and more on UNCLEAR to food supplies and habitat conservation. My oldest and middle daughters are through university, but the youngest is there now. We'll probably look at moving to a slightly smaller house in a few years. I'm still swimming as much as ever, but the running has had to be cut back, at least until my right knee is replaced. In terms of work, I expect to carry on until at least 70, and probably part-time afterwards. I enjoy it far too much to retire.
