			 I am retired. I go to the gym everyday, I am in excellent health. I am a grandmother, both my boys are happily married, healthy, and doing a job they love. They both have children, that my husband and I see very regularly. I visit my brothers & sister often & they are all well. I spend lots of time in my garden, I have been to college & have learnt Spanish & am now taking a cookery/baking course & also an interior design/soft furnishing course. Financially, we have enough money each month so we don't have to worry. (Bliss!!!)
