			 I am still a teacher with 5 years to go to retirement - I am finding the job more & more stressful but cannot retire early due to financial reasons. I continue to sleep my grandchildren most weekends (may have more now) which is special but exhausting - one has autism. I continue to be unable to afford a holiday, haven't had one is twenty years but my dogs and goats are a good substitute. My relationship with my partner continues to be O.K. we do not spend very much time together due to working long hours - but we don't argue either. I have anaemia, depression and a stomach ulser I hope don't get any worse.
