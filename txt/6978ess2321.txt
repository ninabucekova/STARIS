			 I am 60 years old and full of energy. My eldest boy, {SON1} is at university and {SON2} is studying for his A levels. I now work 2 or 3 days a week. My mortgage is paid off and my husband, {HUSBAND}, and I have enough money from our investments and part-pension (employer) to live very comfortably. I exercise regularly (swim/cycle/yoga) and we take two holidays abroad each year. We bought a house in France a couple of years ago and we have been renovating it - it's great to spend time there regularly with the family and friends. We see our friends at least once a month.
