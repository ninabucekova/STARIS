			 I am now 60 yrs old. Both of my children have left home and have good career's. My husband is looking towards early retirement. We hopefully will move down to the coast, as we will have to leave our house as it is tied to his job. Health is relatively good, enjoying cinema's visits and lots of reading. Plus be in a happy state of mind to be able to enjoy the time I should have to myself and my family. Would also enjoy being able to do some voluntary work within the community. Then again time may be taken up looking after grandchildren!
