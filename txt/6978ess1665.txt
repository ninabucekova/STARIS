			 Hopefully I wont be here when I'm 60 as I have no wish to grow old in this country but can't afford to move - however should worst come to worst and I am still around I should imagine I will be doing the same boring job I've been doing for the past few years (I'll not be able to afford to retire!) I'll probably still live next to noisy immigrants who bring down the quality of my free time and disturb my sleep by shouting about at night-time, I'll still be hounded for council tax for a useless council, still struggle to pay gas, electric and water bills and still find grocery shopping more expensive than I can afford - or with a bit of luck - I'll be dead by then!
