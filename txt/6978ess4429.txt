			 I am now retired, living with my husband in a village near or on the South Coast of England. I am still active in fund raising for CRUK. Join in all social activities in our neighbourhood. We have a dog which we take for long daily walks. We are relaxed and in good health. Still enjoy hobbies of gardening and trips to the theatre. Both our daughter are married and we now have grandchildren.
