			 BEING 60 I WOULD IMAGINE THAT I WOULD STILL BE WORKING, ALTHOUGH HOPEFULLY NOT IN SUCH A PHYSICAL JOB AS I AM IN NOW. I WOULD HAVE SOLD MY MOTORBIKE, BUT STILL BE TINKERING WITH MY PROJECT ONE. MY CHILDREN WOULD HAVE THEIR OWN LIVES WITH THEIR FAMILIES & WE WOULD PROBABLY BE GRANDPARENTS. MY WIFE AND I WOULD BE OUT & ABOUT & GOING AWAY MORE.
