			 I expect my life to be fairly similar to the life I lead now. Perhaps some of the children will have left home. Hopefully I should be slightly better off than I am now as the last of the children will have fallen, the mortgage will be paid off etc. Since I like spending time outside, I hope that my health has not deteriorated to the extend that it is restricting me and the activities I do. I shall expect to be working and doing the same job that I do now.
