			 Now that I am 60 and retired, I enjoy swimming a few times a week and going to the bowling with my husband. I am hoping that I have good health and a good pension and able to enjoy holidays abroad 2 or 3 times a year. Each Friday morning I work in the local charity shop and my husband and I meet friends for coffee. My children, their partners and now grandchildren come every Sunday for lunch and I lucky that they stay locally and can visit at any time.
