			 I see myself still working in my present job. I expect I will be living on my own, as my son will probably be married and will have moved out. My health will probably be worse than it is now, due to ageing. I will continue to exercise, swim, use the gym & attend Pilates classes as this will help with fitness & flexibility. I will continue to attend church as this is important to me. I would like to move to a house with a larger garden in order to grow fruit & vegetables and become more self sufficient.
