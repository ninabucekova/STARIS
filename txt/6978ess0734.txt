			 At 60 years old, I would like to be retired from full time work, maybe doing some part-time or voluntary work. I hope my husband would still have good health and we could continue travelling and spending time walking the dog in the countryside. Hopefully I would have grandchildren and our family remained close by. I cannot imagine being 60... I cannot say I feel 50. So I find it hard to imagine anything other than my life now. I try to live now and not look that far ahead, it is out of my control.
