			 I have just taken early retirement from work. I am still active, playing tennis once a week and golf as often as possible. We travel abroad several times a year, still camping, and walk our dogs extensively every day. I have a part-time job helping out a local builder when it suits me and I am doing some part time voluntary work in book keeping for some local charities. We have down sized our property, but still live in the same area. What spare time we have is spent with our granchildren.
