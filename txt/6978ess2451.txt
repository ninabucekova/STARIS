			 I spend my time with my husband of 43 years we go for long walks, weather permitting. We enjoy traveling and spend most of the British winter in {PLACE Asia}. During the summer we try to spend time with our grandchildren when they can fit it in around their work and studying. Eating out or cooking for our friends is still how I like to socialize.
