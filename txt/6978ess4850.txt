			 I anticipate being in fairly good health ten years on since my health generally seems to be improving. My husband will be in his late 70's by the year 2018 so I imagine he may need some care at home by then. Hopefully I will still be able to work part-time. My children will be 23 & 21 years old and will probably have completed their education and be independent, with families of their own maybe.?! My interests will probably be still enjoying gardening, church life and contacts and family & friends & Good books!
