			 I hope that in 10 years time when I am sixty life will be more settled than it is now. I would like to feel still happy with my partner and living in our own home. I hope I will be continuing with the interests I enjoy now, dancing, walking, swimming, friends, conversation. Visits with family. I think I am reasonable healthy now, an hope that this will continue. I wish for happiness and good health for my 3 children. I enjoy my work and hope I will still have similar work when I am sixty, I would also hope that I may be able to use some of my massage skills to make some money, as I enjoy this work most.
