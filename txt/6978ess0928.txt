			 I have managed to return to some of the pleasure of my younger days now that my daughters are 18, 21, and 23. I can go on walking holidays, fishing and sailing with my wife. Home life is great, my daughters are content and so are my wife and I. We are all in relatively good health. The photography business is thriving and we are able to be more involved in church and community.
