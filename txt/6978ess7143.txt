			 I am still living in the same house with {PARTNER}, my partner. Maybe we've finally got married, but it's not that important either way. But we're also spending more time in our second home - we've sold our caravan in West Wales, with some regret, but we've been able to buy a small cottage in France. We're also still having great holidays all over the world - with the mortgage paid off there's more money for holiday pot! I'd like to be retired, but because {PARTNER} can't retire before next year, I'm still working part time. I'm also doing some voluntary work for a charity - it's nice to have the time to give something back. I still do a bit of freelance proof-reading too. I'm still very lucky with my health - a few aches and niggles, but nothing to worry about. Now I'm not working full time, we've got a dog, and she gets me out walking every day. I'm doing more home cooking, and growing vegetables in the garden
