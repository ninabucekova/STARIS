			 I am a well paid consultant in my industry sector, hopefully of reasonable health. Financially well off, with a diverse selection of interests and hobbies. Well travelled, with only illness being commensurate with age. I will be still with my wife, and we will be enjoying our later years. Feeling that we deserve it after at times in the past we have struggled. We will have generous holidays.
