			 I can't really imagine being sixty - I keep wondering what I'm going to be when I grow up, as it is. However, I'm hoping that I'll continue to have a happy family life, even though my children will probably have left home. I hope that I'll remain healthy, active + positive + that any health problems. I do have can be managed successfully. I expect I'll still be growing vegetables, reading avidly + knitting at every opportunity. In an ideal world I'd be running my own yarn shop but that's unlikely to happen until I win the lottery. I'd like to write a book about knitting lace + perhaps be doing some teaching.
