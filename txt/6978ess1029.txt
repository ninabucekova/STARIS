			 JUST TURNED 60 NOT LONG TO GO NOW BEFORE I RETIRE - IVE ALWAYS PLANNED TO RETIRE JUST AS CLOSE TO 60 AS I CAN. LIFE IS GOOD, HEALTH IS GOOD, STILL MANAGE TO WALK, GARDEN AND PLAY SPORT. MYSELF AND THE WIFE LIKE HOLIDAYING WITH MY DAUGHTER AND HER DOGS. AND LIKE FROM 40 TO 50 AND 50 TO 60 I STILL FIND MORE THINGS TO GET INTERESTED IN. SO I IMAGINE THE NEXT 10 YEARS WILL BE THE SAME.
