			 AT 60, I HOPE TO BE ABOUT TO RETIRE FROM MY JOB IN THE NHS, SO MY HUSBAND & I CAN SPEND MORE TIME TRAVELLING. I WOULD HOPE TO HAVE SOME GRAND-CHILDREN BY THEN AND THAT I WILL BE ABLE TO VISIT THEM OFTEN. I WOULD ALSO EXPECT TO BE VERY INVOLVED IN THE CARE OF MY ELDERLY PARENTS, IF THEY ARE STILL ALIVE THEN. HOPEFULLY, I WILL STILL BE PLAYING TENNIS, BUT MIGHT HAVE TO GIVE UP BADMINTON BY THEN.
