			 At 60 years old I don't think my life will have changed a lot. My interests would be the same i.e History, television, reading & researching my ancestory. I think at 60 I would be thinking of retiring.@My health would deteriate with time as most peoples do. Although I do hope to be happier than I am now but do not know what to do to achieve it.
