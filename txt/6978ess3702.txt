			 I expect to be still in full-time employment with another five years until retirement. My mortgage would have been paid off five years previously, enabling me to save/invest more towards my pension. However, should my finances be in better shape than I anticipate, I would like to think that I may be able to work only 3 or 4 days per week and use the free time to do things I haven't yet had the time or funds to do, such as further education; persuing creative interests; and travelling. Having never married or had a partner I don't expect the situation to have changed, but would still be open to the possibility of meeting a long-term companion.@Hopefully, my diabetes would be well-controlled and I won't have developed any debilitating secondary illness. Mentally, I expect to still have an active and alert mind and generally to be in good spirits.
