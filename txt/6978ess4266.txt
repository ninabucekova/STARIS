			 BY 60, I WOULD HOPE TO BE RETIRED, WITH A DECENT WORK-RELATED PENSION. KEEPING IN TOUCH WITH FORMER WORK COLLEAGUES ON A REGULAR BASIS. TAKING PART IN ACTIVITIES THAT INTEREST ME STILL. I HOPE TO DO SOME VOLUNTARY WORK AT THE HOSPITAL, SO SIMILAR, WHERE I CAN MIX WITH PEOPLE AND FEEL I AM GIVING SOMETHING BACK, MAKING A DIFFERENCE TO OTHERS. MANAGE FINANCIALLY, WITHOUT WORRY. PERHAPS TRAVEL A LITTLE RELAX MORE, BUT KEEP IN TOUCH WITHOUT THE STRESSES THAT I HAVE AT PRESENT (50).
