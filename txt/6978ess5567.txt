			 I am delighted to have now retired although I am keeping in touch with school and supporting the pupils when possible. My daughters have now completed university and are enjoying life We are glad that we moved nearer to the shops but miss the farm (but not the work!). We take frequent holidays eg weekend trips and are also grabbing the chance to go to the theatre more. I feel fitter now that I'm doing more gardening but my back does creak a little more these days. Must go now as friends coming for supper . . .
