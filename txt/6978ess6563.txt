			 Living in the same house with our menagerie! I am still working as my youngest child is only 17. My eldest child is finishing university and my middle child working with animals. My husband and I take a few more holidays especially to visit my brothers in Australia - Now the children are older we have more time for each other and regularly go out to the theatre and restaurants.
