			 I will be working in the Care sector My son will be 25 and hopefully settled in a good job. I will be seeing the same friends I have had for years and hopefully some new ones. I will have moved home to either a house or a ground floor flat. I will have pets probably cats. If I win the lottery before this I will open a rescue centre for animals That is my dream. However I will be volunteering at Rescue Centre until then!!!
