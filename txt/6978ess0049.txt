			 I'M STILL WORKING AND KEEPING FAIRLY ACTIVE WITH SUCH THINGS AS PLAYING FOR MY LOCAL BOWLS CLUB AND GOING OUT FOR MEALS AND SOCIALISING IN GENERAL. I AM STILL TRYING TO GIVE UP SMOKING BUT FINDING IT HARD. I'M STILL MARRIED TO THE SAME WOMAN I MARRIED IN 1979. I AM EVER THE OPTIMIST, GLASS HALF FULL RATHER THAN HALF EMPTY, AND STILL ENJOYING LIFE.
