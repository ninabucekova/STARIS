			 Hope/ we are traveling to places far & wide visiting countries we havn't been to! Looking after the grandchildren when needed. Hope to be healthy & fit to walk places, and also hope the mind keeps well! Most of all hope to still be doing a little work. Doing the caring Im doing today with the elderly. Hope to have the good friendship & closeness I've got with my children!!
