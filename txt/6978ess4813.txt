			 My health has depreciated over the last few years but I can still do some activities. My husband and I are able to do more things together now the children are older and this increases my sense of well being. I have not been able to work for a long time but enjoy making birthday and christmas cards and reading. The children are a source of happiness to me and we are very close.
