			 Well I'm 60 years old, enjoying life with a few more grey hairs now than when I was 50 years old. I'm still working (Pharmacy Assistant) as I need to be earning so I can live. I have rented my house out so I can get some money from it but I'm living in a smaller place but that will do for me as I don't really need much room just for me as the kids have grown up + left. I go to Bingo a lot of the time because if give me a buzz to win some money and something to do - I have lost most of my teeth and I wear false one's now but I have to say they are a lot whiter than my real ones were!!! I have had four operations now, two of those are to do with my hernias the third to do with my arm (Rotary UNCLEAR) and finally is a UNCLEAR and thankfully they all went very well.
