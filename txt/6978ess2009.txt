			 Now I am 60 I feel very lucky to have the life I have now. Although I was on my own while the children were growing up. Tax credits etc helped me and we could still afford a nice house and holidays abroad. I now have a lovely man in my life and having paid off my morgage we can do lots of things together. I still make some curtains and work part time as self employed but also have time for my healing (recki, herb and heath) to help others, and my music - dance and playing guitar and piano. With the shift in the earth's plates and axis at the end of 2012, and colapse of banking and money systems, this caused havoc at the time but people have returned to the more important things in life - caring for each other, comunity love has returned and people now find fun in the simple things in life rather than the materialistic vices of the past. life has had many changes, but people now salve each other and many are happier. Its so nice to be out of the rat-race and the Children are happy in their lives. Now we are all 51, the survey you have done would be very interesting from an astrology point of view. We are all sun in pisces with mercury (the way we think and comunicate) there too. Many of us later in the UNCLEAR will have had mercury square saturn which could have given us difficulties in comunication, writing and spelling early on in life. With Jupiter, Neptune and the north node in scorpio square our Venus and Uranus opposition we have all had our lessons to learn in our own depth, UNCEAR and truth and has to combine that with what we value in relationships with others and our own individuality. There will have been certain times over the years that may have been turning points or difficult times in our lives for simalar reasons. In experienced astrologer could look into this and would know what questions to ask for research. Hope you find this interesting PERSONAL
