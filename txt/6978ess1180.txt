				 National Child Development Study: Sweep 8, 2008-2009 
		 
			 In 10 years time my family will continue to be my focus. My children will have completed their studies at University and will hopefully be pursuing interesting & valuable careers. They may be married & I look forward to welcoming their partners into our family. There may be grandchildren with whom I hope to forge a close & enduring relationship, although I fear that geographical differences will make this more difficult I hope my husband & I will enjoy new experiences & will travel together & I look forward to a time when we will have more time and some freedom from responsibilities. At 60 I envisage that I will contine to teach swimming & will still be involved with competitive swimming. I trust my health will continue to be good and that I will stay as busy & as active as I am now. Given additional time I would also like to take up a new craft & maybe join a choir. I look forward to the next decade & its challenges & changes.
