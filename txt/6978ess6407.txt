			 I am 60 years old and in good health. My boys are doing well, no grandchildren yet. We live on the {PLACE South East England} coast, my husband works part-time in London, so we have time for each other and our interests. I like to go on short walking holidays, and like Pilates. We look forward to holidays together, discovery of far away places and people, new cultures, love Spain (NOT COSTA'S) I work for a charity shop, voluntary work or at a primary school listening to readers. I have my friends and enjoy holidaying with my special girlfriend so we can laugh together. I like to help her as well with money. We have a small house but large garden because my husband grows bonsai trees. I love to be by the sea, and enjoy the clean air.
