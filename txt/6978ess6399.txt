			 I am still in full-time work, but taking longer breaks more often. I am able to devote much of that spare time to my partner & grown up family. I may have grandchildren to spoil also. I would like to be involved in something productive within the local area, or creative. Hopefully many of the household jobs will have been completed and I can sit back and enjoy the house & garden more often. Unless fuel is so extortionately priced, I expect to still be 'playing' with cars in some way.
