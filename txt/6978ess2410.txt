			 I had enough money to retire at 58 and, with my mortgage paid and lower expenses (eg work attire, travel costs etc) I consider myself financially secure. I have also invested my lump sum on retirement in a property in {COUNTRY Europe}, so I divide my time between London and Cumbria. While in London I do some supply teaching or other work on a part time basis to supplement my income, and in {COUNTRY} I spend my time either writing my semi-autobiographical novel or leading groupos of British or American tourists on historical visits. I've maintained my romantic relationship in {COUNTRY}, which is fulfilling and very happiness-inducing. I have a wide circle of friends both in London and {COUNTRY}. My health is excellent as always. I believe strongly in keeping both my body and brain active, so I have a number of pursuits which I regularly engage in.
