			 I would like to hope I'll feel much the same at 60 as I do at 50. I would obviously expect to have slowed down a little more and maybe start to have some minor health problems. As one of the first groups of women to have to work until 65 I hope I'll still be active and comptent enough to carry out my job at the same efficent level and, above all, still have a job! As my mortgage will be nearly ended maybe I could then afford to have work carried out to improve my home. I would still expect to be single but I would hope to still have family member living close by. I imagine my interest and hobbies to be much the same as now as by still having to work full time I wouldn't have any more lesiure time. I would like to hope I might have gained new skills by finally owning a computer at home!
