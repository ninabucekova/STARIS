			 I have finally cracked the home - work balance - I've retired !! I am still doing the occasional bit of supply teaching but have become more involved with my village's activities - voluntary, RSPB and environmental work. I run a childrens art and crafts club in the local hall, which is well supported by the local community. Health wise I am much fitter having finally got my weight under control. I'll never be 'twiggy' but Im playing tennis, walking my dog and swimming - many of my aches and pains I experienced at 50 have disappeared! I have finished my mortgage and have no debts. There is much to look forward to with my family and friends !
