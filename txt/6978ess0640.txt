			 My daughter would be 26yrs old hopefully settled into a job following university - I'll have or about to down size into a small cottage locally - I'll be about to retire or reduce hours - thinking about getting a dog - doing voluntary work - be surrounded by local nephew & neices (5) and local friends - and start doing the things that we did when we were 16 yrs old & growing up. Might consider some VSO. Health depending?
