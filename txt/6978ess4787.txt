			 I live with my husband and enjoy gardening walking and sharing time with friends. My children have left home and are independent but I still see them fairly frequently. I am fit and well and still able to do yoga. We have sold our business but can live comfortably. I enjoy contact with the Priory and we do some voluntary work.
