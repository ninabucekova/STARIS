			 I am still enjoying my work making radio programmes and training others to do so. I am getting about quite freely although my weak back continues to limit my activities to a certain extent. My husband is now 92, and although he needs some help, he is still quite active - certainly mentally. He is still a lot of fun to be with and I really enjoy his company, and benefit a lot from his wisdom and care for me. I relax by reading, watching the TV and occasionally visiting the theatre. My christian faith is very important to me and informs my decisions and my general positive attitude to life. I don't fear death, but I'm in no hurry to get there as life is still a lot of fun!
