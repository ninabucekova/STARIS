			 I imagine that at 60 I will be retiring from teaching and looking forward to enjoying my retirement with my wife. I imagine if my health improves/does not deteriorate that I will be visiting the gym/swimming pool every other day to keep active. I hope to travel extensively to the many countries I have taught about as a Geography Teacher. My wife and I will regularly go for walks in the countryside. I would like to think that I will do some voluntary work and give time to helping my 2 children build their homes and maybe help them with the grandchildren?!
