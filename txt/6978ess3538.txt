			 I am 60 . . . I will be in paid employment, probably still with the NHS but involved in some type of overseas/charity work as well. I will still be happily married to my wife, all three children will have left home, all been through university and in pursuit of their chosen careers. Possibly some type of 'caring role' for elderly parents. I will still be living in {PLACE}, {REGION South West England}. The mortgage will have been paid off & I will live in the same house as now. I will be in good health, good mobility & able to take moderate exercise on a regular basis. I won't be in such a stressful job but using my experiences to the full, within a caring environemnt. I will still be an active Church member, enjoying supporting my football team - still in close contact with all my family.
