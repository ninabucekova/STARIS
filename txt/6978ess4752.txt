			 I am 60 still doing pretty much the same things as when I was 50. Getting a few aches and pains but generally fit and healthy still living in the same house as ten years ago with my dear husband who keeps himself busy with work, as well as long term interests as do I, still enjoying our grandchildren and helping out their mums and dads as much as we can. My husband being the main breadwinner and me doing my bit to bring enough for lifes extras, still childminding and loving the childrens enthusiasm and energy for learning and life. Helping out other people where I can.
