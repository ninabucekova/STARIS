			 When I am 60 I hope to be still working at least part time maybe carrying on working with children. Homelife will carry on with my love of gardening & the environment around me. My children & Grandchildren will I am sure carry on being a large and rewarding part of life. My health and that of my husband will continue to be good, letting us travel and enjoy all around us.
