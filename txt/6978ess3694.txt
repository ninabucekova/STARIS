			 Hopefully I will still be enjoying good health and be working in my social work profession. My social life will remain active and revolve around family, friends, night classes and church activities. With an adult daughter and no mortgage I might be able to travel more to places of interests or again I might be a doting grandmother and helping out - I've always thought I would work less hours if I was needed to help with child care. I really would like to spend time with grandchildren and have that special relationship which my daughter enjoyed with my mother.
