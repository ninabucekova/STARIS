			 I AM STILL INVOLVED IN THE SAME EMPLOYMENT OR I AM WORKING IN A RELATED ROLE I HAVE STARTED TO SUFFER WITH SOME MINOR HEALTH ISSUES SUCH AS ARTHRITIS AS A RESULT OF PLAYING SPORT OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS BOTH OF MY PARENTS HAVE DIED WHICH HAS CAUSED ME DISTRESS BECAUSE I WAS VERY CLOSE TO THEM. I AM LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE, STILL MARRIED AND ENJOYING MOST OF THE SAME INTERESTS SUCH AS FOOTBALL HOLIDAYS AND MIXING WITH OLD FRIENDS. I AM STILL TRYING TO STAY FIT AND LEAD A HEALTHY LIFE AND AVOID THE HEALTH PROBLEMS WHICH AFFECTED MY PARENTS.
