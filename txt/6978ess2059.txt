			 At 60 I would hope to be completing my career as a Headteacher in a local primary school, or in an advisory capacity to support other teachers/students/local authority. As my health is usually good I take advantage of regular exercise to keep fit in mind and body and to share leisure time with friends, eating meals and especially theatre visits. I would also like to be enjoying a new lease of life with my grandchildren (when my sons eventually provide me with them!!) and to perhaps take up a new hobby with my leisure time. In addition I would like to increase the amount of voluntary work I do and to take more active role in this field.
