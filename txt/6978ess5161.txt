			 I AM NOW LIVING IN THE LAKE DISTRICT & WITH MY WIFE HAVE BOUGHT A B & B WHICH WILL PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE INCOME TO KEEP US COMFORTABLE IN OUR OLD AGE. OUR FRIENDS COME & VISIT US & BECAUSE WE HAVE PLENTY OF ROOM OUR CHILDREN & GRANDCHILDREN LOVE TO COME & STAY WITH US ON A REGULAR BASIS. MY WIFE & I HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO ENJOY LONG WALKS TOGETHER & MAYBE TAKE UP NEW HOBBIES TOGETHER. DUE TO WORD OF MOUTH I STILL GET WORK AS A DECORATOR BUT I ONLY WORK PART-TIME BECAUSE WE LIVE IN THIS AREA FOR THE QUALITY OF LIFE & WANT TO HAVE TIME TO ENJOY IT.
