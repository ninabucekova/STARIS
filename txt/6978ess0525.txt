			 I STILL EXPECT TO BE MARRIED AND BOTH MY WIFE AND I WILL PROBABLY BE WORKING IN A SIMILAR CAPACITY TO TODAY. MY CHILDREN WILL BE IN THEIR LATE-TWENTIES AND MAY HAVE HAD CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN BY THEN. WITH THEIR EDUCATION COMPLETED I EXPECT TO HAVE MORE DISPOSABLE INCOME AND, IF SO, WOULD LIKE TO TRAVEL MORE THAN IS POSSIBLE AT PRESENT. I HOPE AND EXPECT MY HEALTH TO BE SIMILAR TO HOW IT IS AT PRESENT ALTHOUGH IT WILL BE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF AND TAKE REGULAR AND APPROPRIATE EXERCISE.
