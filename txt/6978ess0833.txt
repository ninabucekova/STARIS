			 I would like to think that I have either retired or "just keeping my hand in" with a very small amount of UNCLEAR consultancy work. I would like to either living in France or may South West England - but keeping a small flat in Edinburgh. I would like to be travelling, playing golf and keeping tabs on my two step sons. Obviously we now have to take great care of our "capital" ie money accumulated by waiting for Edinburgh property prices to bounce back. As we are patient we aim to see this through and work hard to achieve the travel and relocation we look forward to.
