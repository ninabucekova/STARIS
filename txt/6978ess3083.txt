			 At 60 I hope to be practising as a counseller and have a range of clients. I think I will still be in good health and I hope my husband will be too (he has had a heart attack). I imagine I will still be living in this house and that I will still enjoy my relationships with neighbours and friends. I envisage doing voluntary work in counselling and in the community arts festival in our town. I hope to have close relationships with my step-children and step-grandchildren. I am in the process of a change of career now(at 50) in order to continue working into my 60s.
