			 I have no idea how I will be living my life at 60, as the way I live it may be out of my control... But I hope that my health will allow me to live pretty much as I do now - I exercise a lot and will continue to do so as long as I am able. I expect to be living in the same house, with the same wife! I hope still to be riding my motorcycle (or a better one!) With the kids grown up I may have more time to pursue interests that I've let lapse - drawing, photography, reading, travel, maybe even get to grips with learning to play guitar (finally) or speaking Italian. I'm, optimistic that my health will continue and expect to be living pretty much as I am now; no happier, being bound by the same values, to responsibilities ... and the views and actions of others in my life over which I have no control or influence. I expect to fulfill my resposibilities to the best of my ability and comfort and enjoyment where I can.
