			 Retired, still fairly healthy and happy. Looking forward to granchildren now my Son is 30 years old and hopefully in employment and a good relationship. Enjoying the freedom retirement brings travelling more often and spending time with relatives & friends. Regularly attending keep fit sessions and adult learning, soft furnishings, painting & photography Housework & garden do not feel as much of a chore now fits in better with my schedule.
