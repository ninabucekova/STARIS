			 AT 60 I HAVE FINALLY STOPPED PLAYING FOOTBALL AND TAKEN UP YOGA. I STILL CYCLE TO WORK AND I LIKE DOING THE GARDEN MORE THAN EVERY. I AM SPENDING MORE TIME PAINTING. MY GIRLS ARE BOTH DOING WELL WITH THEIR OWN JOBS AND FAMILIES. WE STILL SE A FAIR BIT OF THEM WHICH IS GREAT. I STILL ENJOY MY WORK BUT I THINK I'M BEGINNING TO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING LESS DAYS/WEEK AS I WIND DOWN TO EVENTUAL RETIREMENT, BUT I SUSPECT I'LL KEEP MY HAND IN FOR A GOOD FEW YEARS YET. MY PENSION PLAN IS NOT THAT GREAT ANYWAY AND {PARTNER} MY PARTNER, WILL KEEP UP HER WORK FOR A LONG TIME YET. I HAVE TO WEAR GLASSES FOR READING ALL THE TIME NOW. {PARTNER} WANTS TO MOVE OUT OF THE CITY AND GET A DOG. THESE ARE BOTH DAFT IDEAS AND THATS WHAT WE DISAGREE ABOUT MOST . . . BUT NOT MUCH ELSE. (I SOUND LIKE A REALLY SMUG OLD GIT . . . AND THAT'S PROBABLY RIGHT)
