			 I've lost weight and am now a comfortable size 12!! I still walk most days for at least 40 minutes. My health is good and I socialise more than I did when I was 50. I take time out for myself and have contrived to develop my drawing and artistic skills. I see more of my sisters and spend more time in London than I do in {PLACE East Midlands England}. (homes in both places). I continue to support good causes in my free time. My son is nearly married and grand-children may come soon (I hope!). Life is good, healthy & generally my family and friends are happy & healthy too. I developed a small internet business 9 years ago and it provides a small but steady income without too much effort. I still love spending time with people and am passionate about politics & human rights (WILL THIS COME TRUE!!??)
