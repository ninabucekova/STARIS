			 At 60 I hope to be doing interesting work on a project, 'as & when' basis, but also to be spending more time holidaying, both in this country & abroad incl. some long haul travel. Currently I am getting over a whiplash injury, but at 60 I would hope not to have any after effects, & to be in v. good health - mind and body. I hope to be still walking, swimming & cycling regularly. I'd like to be doing more voluntary work as a way of 'putting something back' into the community. I see my homelife continuing to be settled, but by 60 just {HUSBAND} & me at home with our daughters independent, I want to maintain excellent & loving relationships with both of them, and I think I will. The type of work I do is mostly H.R. - I see myself continuing to work in people development.
