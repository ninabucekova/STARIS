			 I keep busy even though my daughter is now 20 years old. I still love the garden & spend as much time as I can there. I enjoy reading, meeting with friends & ex colleagues, & travel with my husband. My health is good, the odd ache & pain but nothing too bad. The main thing is to keep active. I keep in touch with school & help out on the odd day.
