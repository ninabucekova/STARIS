			 I currently envolved as a self employed Sales Consultant and I imagine this will continue for some time. I am currently training to be a driving instructor and would envisage this is what I will do at the age of 60. I have a busy social life involving several children both my own and others from previous relationships covering a wide age range. A great deal of time in the summer is spent supporting the children in the local cricket club. At the age of 60 I would hope to in good health and be able to have greater free time to spend with my partner, traveling and spend more time on my interests such as motorbikes, DIY, cooking.
