			 I like the idea of being able to persue my painting and take it further, perhaps even doing an MA in fine art or related subject. I don't think I will be singing in a band when I am 60 but then I can't imagine not doing it so perhaps I will be singing in the choir or certainly doing music of some kind with friends. I would also like to be playing and learning a musical instrument, piano or guitar I have played them in the past but never had time to improve. I would like to be earning money through my painting and possibly to some degree through my singing. I would also like to be spending some of my time in my 60s travelling and exploring this country and further afield and doing more walking especially amongst hills with my husband, I like the idea of spending more time holidaying and relaxing with my husband and being healthy enough and able to do more leisure activities. Possibly putting something back into the community also.
