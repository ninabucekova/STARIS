			 I have now retired + am thoroughly enjoying life without the stress of work. I am enjoying having more time to look after my home, everything is much tidier! I feel much more relaxed and am enjoying walking often in my favourate place, down the UNCLEAR with my husband who has also retired. It's tood to be able to visit my Daughter & Son in Law more often. I'm still feeling well & able to enjoy life. Also have more time to take part in Church activities & groups
