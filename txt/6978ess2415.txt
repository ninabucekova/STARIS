			 I have more free time because my children are now 22 and 18 - they are less dependent on me. I still keep fit and I am still in good health. I still have a tendency to put on a few pounds & then try to lose it! I may be doing some work part time and will still be doing some voluntary work. I hope I have improved my French & learnt to play the piano! I still walk with my girlfriends & have regular weekends away with them having fun.
