			 I hope that I continue to be as healthy as possible, and I hope that my family are all healthy and happy - My mother will be 92 so hopefully she will still be around but will be taking up a lot of my time. I hope to be living in the country, with some land. I hope to own my own horse and have more dogs & cats. I would be happy to be running a business eg. cattery.
