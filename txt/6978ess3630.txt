			 I am self employed, working part time as a book keeper. I am living in a coastal town and am actively involved in environmental issues. My family visit & my grandchildren come to stay during the holidays. I cycle & walk on a regular basis & have a large garden where I grow all my own vegetable & keep chickens. My health is good, although I feel tired at times. I have short holidays visiting places of cultural interest. I keep in touch with my friends.
