			 I have made more time for myself, I am still very happily married, our sons have done very well in their own lives and are happy with their partners. I am still working in the NHS - my health is pretty good, I have had surgery on my ugly feet? and I have lost weight and managed to keep it off! Most important of all - I am at peace with myself and except that I will never have the relationship that I would have liked with my mother - and I am still missing my wonderful father who passed away this year.
