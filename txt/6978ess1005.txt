			 When I'm 60 I'd like to be leading pretty much the same sort of life I'm leading now. I'd still like to be walking my dogs, going to the gym, socialising & having plenty of interests. I hope by then our mortgage will be repaid, therefore we could take a cut in income if we had to. My main goal is to be happy & healthy.
