			 I am leading a comfortable lifestyle. I am still working and enjoying the benefits of the extra income enabling me to travel and enjoy a comfortable life. The family have grown up and left home and are well settled and it is nice to be in a financial position to give them a few luxuries in life. My health is not too bad, no worse that it has been over the last few years.
