			 I am enjoying my retirement in full, after 35 years of full, active and very satisfactory employment. I have my family and close circle of friends about me, and my mother has slowed down, which has allowed me to catch up with her! My son {SON1} is happy in full time employment and is very happy and content with his life. My beloved sister is home in Glasgow and I am doing voluntary work along side her. I have no financial problems and I am healthy and contented.
