			 At 60 I expect my interests will be much the same as they have always been; gardening (although limited by my health) reading, watching TV and knitting. I would hope that I will still be happily married to {HUSBAND} and that we will still be living in Wales; although perhaps not in this village - who knows. Being a pragmatist I doubt my health will be any better, as I have never enjoyed good health; it is a bind and has prevented me from working for a good number of years. But who knows science may come up with a solution and I may be running the country by 2018!! No doubt I shall still be filling in forms for NCDS.
