			 60 Will still be working - can't ever see how I can afford to retire! Will probably still be renting a property - looking ahead - cannot see how I will be able to afford to buy again - Will have been married to my husband for 10 years - all happy - but both still working hard. One good holiday a year. Have several Grandchildren by now, so they take up any spare time I have when not working. Health wise - good I hope - At the end of the day - live every day to the full, none of us knows whats around the corner. Enjoy your children & grandchildren & make the most of every day.
