			 As part of this survey, I remember completing a section like this in the late 1960s (early 1970s about what I expected my life to be like when I was 25. It must have been when I was about 11. It is therefore interesting nearly 40 years on to be asked the same sort of questions. I very much hope that I will continue to enjoy good health when I am 60 and that my family and friends will still do so although I am realistic enough to realise that my elderly parents (now 80) will probably be dead. I hope my children now 12 and 19 will have successfully completed their UNCLEAR education and will have fulfilling jobs and perhaps settled and happy long term relationships. I hope my husband will retire but find something interesting to do. As for me, I hope to have completed another degree, have time for my friends and family and enjoy my dog even if it is another one!
