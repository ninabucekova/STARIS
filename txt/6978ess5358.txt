			 The children will probably have left home except the youngest - so more time but maybe lonely as alot of my social life is linked to theirs at the moment. The dog will be elderly so less daily walking but I hope I shall still be keeping fit. Financial state - can not be worse than at the moment! Will be renting not owning a house want to have moved to a new area. Hope to have been to a new area. Hope to have been a foster parent for at least a few years. Not looking forward to being 60!
