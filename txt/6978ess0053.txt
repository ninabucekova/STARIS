			 Hopefully I will retire at 60 and will be leading a comfortable life with my children + grandchildren. Going on holidays abroad frequently + maybe have a property abroad to go to & stay some months. My health would be ok although I smoke, and still in a long term relationship. I have made some mistakes in my life, but having my 3 children and seeing them grow up & now having granchildren is the best thing that happened. I have worked from the age of 16 + hopefully I will be able to retire gracefully and will be able to live a comfortable life that would be left for me.
