			 LIFE, I DO NOT THINK WILL NOT BE SO VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IT IS AT THE MOMENT. I AM IN QUITE GOOD HEALTH FOR 50, STOPPED SMOKING SEVERAL MONTHS AGO, I KNOW I AM FITTER THAN PEOPLE HALF MY AGE WHO I WORK WITH. ANYWAY, UNLESS I COME GOOD ON THE LOTTERY OR MARRY INTO MONEY, THING WILL GO ON AS TO-DAY. I WILL NEVER MAKE A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY ROUND HERE. BUT LIVING IN THE LAKE DISTRICT MAKES UP FOR A LOT OF THINGS.
