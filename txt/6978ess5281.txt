			 At 60 I hope to be comfortably well-off and looking to retire, although I would consider part-time and/or casual work. With children left home, I would be looking to enjoy life with my partner, doing the things we enjoy. - travelling - cinema/theatre - walking - socialising/eating out etc. I would like to think I would be healthy enough to enjoy moderately demanding activities and would be exercising sensibly. I would still look to be actively maintaining the house/garden without it taking over my life. I would like to spend time with family & friends and visit them more often.
