			 Life at present is in a state of such great fux and as I feel as if I can't even predict the next day or two, it seems pretty impossible to envisage 10 years hence! However, I would hope that as I will have to be employed to provide income, I will have found a degree of satisfaction / worth in whatever work I do. My husband would be fully retired and if my mum is still alive she would be 90! I would hope my children, or at least one or two of them, would be married & I look forward to time with grandchildren (although they have no inclination / intentions at the moment!) I would hope to still follow my interests, but don't know if my joints will allow me to still be playing tennis!
