			 Hopefully I will be still in good health, perhaps be blessed with healthy grandchildren but if I'm not it won't be end of the world. Hopefully be in a happy relationship, my children settled and happy with their lives. I will prbably be still working, but hopefully not having to work full time, so that I can have time to pursue hobbies such as photography and travel the world, things that I havent had time or funds to do when I was younger. The most important is to be happy with my life, not having to struggle just to get by.
