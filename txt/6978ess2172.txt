			 I imagine that my interests will be much the same as they are now - I cannot imagine changing that much in the next ten years. I am not really involved in strenous sporting activities although I enjoy walking. I read a lot. I enjoy films and cinema, eating out, using my computer for finding things out about anything I am interested in. I do not work at the moment and I hope I will not have to in the future. My husband works long hours, so we really enjoy any time together, especially our yearly holiday in the Greek Islands. My health is alright at the moment - hopefully it will be in ten years time - My family & home are my main interests.
