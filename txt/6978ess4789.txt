			 60 - Still working to pay the bills. Kids have all left home and are all working and doing well. I'm now living with my childhood sweetheart after a gap of 35 years. Still go out on my Harley Davidson whenever we can and cruise the countryside. Living back in England is great! No grandchildren yet.
