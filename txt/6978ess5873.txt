			 I would like to hope that my children are fulfilling a happy prosperous life. I would be able to take early retirement and my health and that of my husband would be sufficient to enable us to enjoy an outdoor life. To continue long rambles with the dogs. To continue gardening and horse riding. I would also hope to be doing some voluntary work with riding for the disabled and elder care within my community.
