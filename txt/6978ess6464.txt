			 Home Life - my kids will range from 16-25yrs so maybe a couple will have left home. Financially I doubt if I will be better off, having at least two of them having gone through expensive further education. I would like to think that at work things will have improved to such an extent that I can look forward to retirement more positively, although I doubt it. I will have continued to run my Scout Troops albeit with more help from younger people. Healthwise I hope to be much as I am now, perhaps & little improved, suspected problems would probably be either teeth or circulation (mainly in my legs). I would prefer to be more relaxed generally and may be even do some thing creative, like write a book.
