			 I would hope to in the same job. My children would have left home. I might have a new partner/husband but don't think I would mind too much if I did not. I would hope to be fit and active and have time to spend on my main hobby (breeding poultry) and also time to spend on my garden and walking and many other things I don't have time for now.
