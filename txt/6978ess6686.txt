			 Well at 60 years old I nolonger have to take my son to his judo training sections five times a week. He is 26 years old now and very independent. I still go to support him at competitions though, but he does the driving. I am still working but as I nolonger have to support myself and my son as a single parent. I changed to a job I want to do. It is not as well paid but a lot less stressfull and far more full filling. I also have time in the evenings to go to evening classes, pottery at the moment but maybe next year I will take a language course. Some evenings I even go swimming, not as fast as I used to be, but hey, can still stay afloat. Still take the annual holiday with my sister but I am planning to visit the friends who emigrated years ago. One to Australia and one to New Zealand.
