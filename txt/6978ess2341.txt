			 I would like to be working parttime in a job similar to what I have now. I would like my children to be completely independent & happy with good jobs & partners / children. I would like to have moved to the country in a less hectic area of England with a little land so I can have the animals I would like to keep. I would like my husband to retire & spend more time with me so we could enjoy walking & other country persuits together. I would like to still be able to run & cycle & to have achieved a 1/2 marathon.
