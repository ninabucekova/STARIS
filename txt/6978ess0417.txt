			 I am sixty !! Having retired when I was fifty-five, I now have time for myself. I swim, embroider, cook and keep fit. I have a villa in France and I like to spend as much time as I can there. At last, I have a cleaner who cleans my house once a week. Twice a week, I work voluntarily with the local children who are not as fortunate as my own sons, which is something I have wanted to do for a long time but having so many commitments, was unable to do. Life is good!! (fingers crossed)
