			 I still work, as changing financial climates have had an impact on my pension and anyway, I can't imagine not working at all! The mortgage is paid and the income allows me to take holidays and weekends away which I love. The kids have both left home but I look forward to their visits and going out together. I still practise yoga as I feel it is important to keep active but general wear and tear mean I'm not as good at it as I would like to be! I also like to relax with a good film or book and a glass or wine and visits to the pub with my husband. Life is not at all bad.
