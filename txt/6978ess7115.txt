			 I am living in the South of France, in a small house with a garden where I grown my own vegetables and fruit. My husband and I are healthy relaxed and enjoy being part of our local community. We look forward to visits from and visiting the family and friends near and far. We have enough money to not worry about our future. We are part of a vibrant church and involve ourselves in this.
