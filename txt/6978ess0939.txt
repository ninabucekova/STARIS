			 I am in good health, happily married & a doting grandparent, am still working, although not spending as much time away from home on business as in previous years, which allows me to spend more valuable time with my wife and family, as well as playing golf more frequently. I am happy with my current situation and am looking forward to spending more and more time with my immediate family.
