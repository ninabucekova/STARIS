			 I don't know what I'll be doing when I am 60, as I donâ€™t plan ahead. If I make plans they always seem to go wrong. So long as I am healthy + still alive, I would be happy. I tend to adapt to which ever situation I happen to be in. I am a great believer in destiny + fate and take whatever life throws at me. I enjoy solving problems + helping people. I enjoy working when I have a job and tend not to worry too much about anything. I enjoy watching wildlife + nature programmes on T.V. Am also interested in the Environment polotics and world News. If I am able to help somebody I get great satisfaction from this. A lot of people tend to take advantage of my Good Nature as I find it hard to say NO to people, putting other before myself. I could have done a lot more in my life but lack ambition things that seem important to you are not as important to me. All in all I have a good life even with all the ups + DOWNS. I wouldn't change it even if I could. Thanks
