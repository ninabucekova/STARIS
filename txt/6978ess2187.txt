			 I am now 60yrs old. I have recently retired and am lucky to have a comfortable pension. My husband is already retired. My 2 children are now 25 and 21 and have left home, although the youngest is still at university so he may be returning home for a while soon. I am fit and healthy and still enjoy walking, cycling, gardening and meeting up with friends. I hope to be able to spend more time enjoying these and other activities as well as doing some voluntary work locally. We have just bought a small camper van and plan to spend a bit of time exploring Britain and Europe, although this may be difficult at present with several frail elderly relatives nearby requiring assistance.
