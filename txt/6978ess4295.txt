			 We (my husband and me) have emigrated to New Zealand for a simpler, more optimistic lifestyle. I am working part-time with elderly people (either paid - probably - or voluntarily). My husband spends a lot of time sailing and fishing and I go with him part of the time. We are living in our own house - a very modest detatched bungalow in a small town. We grow our own vegetables and live simply. I enjoy swimming (hopefully in The Sea!) and chilling out over a coffee in the local cafes. My husband and I are still fairly healthy and his arthritis has improved in the better climate. (we are in North Island). I have finally let my hair go grey and I am confident and happy about who I have turned out to be even though I am far from perfect!
