			 I am physically fit and mentally active, lots of interests, a few "good friends" with numerous "acquaintances". I still work at my present job which I find rewarding. I am not rich, but have enough to spare some money to certain worthwhile charities. I still lead walks for a local groups, and travel abroad going on treks and adventurous holidays.
