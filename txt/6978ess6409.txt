			 I love my job, so I'm still working. I don't expect or want my life to be significantly different from '50'. I'll have the same interests - reading music, films art + architecture + and hopefully I'll have found a few more. Travel is my greatest love + I hope I'll still be able to go abroad for holidays. I hope my home life won't change, but in 10 years time, perhaps my father will have passed away as he is severly disabled by Parkinsons' now. So my responsibilities to my mother will be different. Of course I hope my health will be good i.e. the same as now. Perhaps we will have moved to a different house with a larger garden. I'm quite happy with life at the moment and can't really imagine any changes that could make me happier.
