			 I'm still working at the university. I've been here for 12 years now. I can't afford to retire yet! My health is OK but my eye-sight has deteriorated over the last 10 years. I'm happily married to my wife of 40 years. I have a classic car which I like tinkering with. We're looking foward to grand children. We may move house in preparation for retirement.
