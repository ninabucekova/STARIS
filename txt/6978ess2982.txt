			 IF WE GET THROUGH THE RECESSION. LIVING HERE AT PERSONAL, CONTINUING OUR WORK IN THE GARDEN AND OPENING FOR MORE CHARITY DAYS. I WOULD STILL BE PLAYING TENNIS A FEW TIMES A WEEK AND RIDING A PONY OF SOME KIND. I WOULD BE HOUSE JUDGING AS I AM NOW, SO I DON'T THINK HOPEFULLY IT WOULD BE MUCH DIFFERENT TO NOW. MY ONLY MAIN WORRY WOULD BE MY HUSBANDS HEALTH WOULD STILL BE GOOD. IF WE DON'T SURVIVE. NOT SURE, PROBABLY IN RENTED ACCOMMODATION. WORKING AT WHAT EVER I CAN DO, - I AM NOW AT 50 TOO OLD FOR MY ORIGINAL CAREER OF FASHION BUYER. NOT TIME OR MONEY FOR HOBBIES, JUST MAKING ENOUGH TO SURVIVE. IT IS A REAL WORRY AS ALL MY ASSETS/PENSIONS WERE PUT INTO OUR BUSINESS.
