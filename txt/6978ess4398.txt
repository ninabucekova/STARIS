			 I like to stay fit and active and hope I do not get any illnesses like my parents. My home life is fairly happy, hopefully my children will be working in something they enjoy and are happy in their homelife. Would like to go to the theatre & films regularly if I have enough money and time. Looking after my mother takes up most of my time at moment, so look forward to more free time in future.
