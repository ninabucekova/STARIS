			 Looking around I see my 3 children getting on with their lives they are now 35, 30 & 27. I am proud of the way they have turned out. I am still working at the same job. My homelife is good although my fishing hobby is taking it's toll as Im not as fit as I was. My health is not bad but because I have now smoked for 48 years I have chest problems. I am also at the age my grandmother died and she smoked so Im a bit worried about that. All in all the past 30 years have been good. The first 30 were terrable.
