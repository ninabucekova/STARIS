			 I am enjoying home life with my husband who has now retired. I am on village committees & we enjoy working in the home, garden, allotment & our paddock. We have less animals now & the children live fairly locally. We have more time for travel both in this Country & abroad. We are thinking of moving to a smaller (but not too small!) house. We need space though for grandchildren to stay. We are in pretty good health. I still play the flute at church & attend bible study. My mother is still quite fit but now lives nearer to us in a bungalow. I enjoy music & having occasional evenings socialising with friends. Money is not a problem, but we help the children financially often .life is busy but enjoyable! (most of the time!)
