			 I hope I will still be married and have more leisure time to do things with my husband, such as walking on Dartmoor. I hope I have inherited my mother's genetic make-up and will be fit enough to enjoy playing tennis and engaging in other physical activities. I expect that I will continue to make a contribution to community and church life, assisting where I can to help such activities sun smoothly. I anticipate I may have more caring responsibilities for my mother and mother-in-law who will be about 90. This may restrict some of my activities. I work part-time and envisage this continuing until my early 60s. I hope to see my children frequently. They may not have settled down in ten years time and I may have to provide some financial assistance.
