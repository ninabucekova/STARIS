			 Hopefully I shall still be around and working. The main concern will be my health and god willing all shall be well. I hope that I have grand children and can enjoy that privalidge. I will then have been Married for 40 years and enjoying some quality time with my wife. More holidays a year would be good and hopefully I can still spend time carp fishing as I do now. It would also be good to see both my sons married and settled into their own homes with families. I hope by then to have seen Chelsea fc win the champions league (more than once). God also willing I hope my parents are still around and in good health. Money is the route of all evil however we all need it to keep going. I have created and worked hard all my life and although not easy I have had a reasonable job and hope this will continue. As long as I have enough for a pint & holiday then I will be happy.
