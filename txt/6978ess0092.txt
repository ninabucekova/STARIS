			 I hope to retire in 5 yearsâ€™ time when I am 56. I have 2 houses in {COUNTRY Europe} and I will retire there with my wife. I will have more time to take exercise which I struggle to do at the moment with my hectic way of life. I have had a house in {COUNTRY Europe} for 12 years and feel much more a part of that community because the people are much more friendly than those of the every changing (not for the better) Britain. I feel we as British citizens have 'lost' the country and there is little else to do than move where the values of people are as they were 30 years ago in our country.
