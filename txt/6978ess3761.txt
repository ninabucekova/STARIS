			 I hope to be doing more voluntary work (at the moment I don't have the time). I will still be working full time. My children will probably have their own families which I will see as regularly as I can. I will remain married although my wife will probably be retired then (or work part-time). We will be financially comfortable - taking several holidays / short breaks abroad each year. I hope to retain my good health and to spend time walking in the countryside / hills / mountains.
