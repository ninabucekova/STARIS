			 I hope to be working where I am now as it is such a lovely environment to work in, and as it is a relaxed atmosphere i am sure that this will benefit me health wise. I love walking the dogs and will continue to do this. I am now having more time to enjoy interests with my husband and going out on the motorbike more travelling and exploring areas that we have not visited before. I enjoy having my grandchildren come to stay and going out on trips, learning new things. I still drive so i will be able to visit them. I will be growing more vegetables in my garden as i like to cook with fresh ingredients in order to stay healthy.
