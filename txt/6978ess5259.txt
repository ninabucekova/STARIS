			 I am fifty years old and I am unwilling to imagine I am ten years into the future. Events in the future can be so unexpected. I am not in work and this is some concern to me partly becuse work is a good thing itself. Before I can face the prospect of work, I would like to sell a house I co-own and I am not even ready for the house to go on the market. I am a Christian and my faith gives my great hope for my future. Were I to die tomorrow I will already have had a fantastic life!
