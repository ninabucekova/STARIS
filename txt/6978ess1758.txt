			 I work part time for the library service & enjoy it very much. I enjoy part-time work as it leaves time for other interests in the week, and I can devote a few hours to an Adult Education class or a hobby as well as some voluntary work for our local church. Our daughter is now 20 yrs old and in University. My husband and I enjoy walking, & the summer kayaking. I keep pretty healthy and still go swimming and do a dancing class with a friend. My husband and I like going around National Trust properties, going to the cinema and the theatre. We meet up with friends for a meal occassionally.
