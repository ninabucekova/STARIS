			 I am looking after my parents, going for a few both day and night. I've got various aches and pains and get very tired. I enjoy gardening and going for walks in the country, and going out for a meal sometimes. We take my parents out shopping and to garden centres. I look after my granchildren a few hours a week. Look forward to my 2 week holiday in America every year.
