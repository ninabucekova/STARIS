			 I am married and live with my husband, all my children have left home but have regular contact. I work full time as a community occupational therapist specialising in the area of homeadaptions for people with disabilities. I have recently completed a Masters qualification in Occupational Therapy. I keep reasonably well except for recurrent back pain, however this does not prevent me from doing the things that I enjoy or need to do. I like to swim every week and also work in my Garden. I also enjoy arts and crafts and often make things for my family. Generally I feel my life has continued to be settled and enjoyable and I look forward to being able to continue working until retirement.
