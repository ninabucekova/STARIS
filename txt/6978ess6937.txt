			 I am enjoying more time spend with my husband, weekends are spent walking in the countryside + by the coast. Its lovely to see my son, his wife and the grandchildren and to have quality time with them. In 2 years I am hoping to retire when my husband is 65 + I shall be 62. Money and pension is not everything but time spent with a loved one is.
