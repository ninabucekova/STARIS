			 I am a Director in a family business & still enjoy my work although I can now 'back off' a little & choose my own hours to work, particularly in the summer when I enjoy my golf. I have a wonderful social life & am a member at a local Golf & Country Club. I still enjoy the gym & Pilates & spinning & play Golf as often as I can. I also love to read & am a member of a local Book Club. Because I have maintaind a good level of fitness I am still able to ski during the winter & try to go at least twice during the season. I am very close to my 2 sons and have already started to teach my grandchildren to ski & play golf. I love to help out with my grandchildren & feel very priveledged to be a part of their lives. My husband is a wonderful man who shares most of my hobbies & sporting interests and we have a lot of fun together both at home and during our travels. My Parents although not as agile as they were, still enjoy good health & we are very close, as I still am to my brother & sister. I consider myself extremely fortunate!
