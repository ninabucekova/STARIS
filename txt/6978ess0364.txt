			 MY LIFE IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHEN I WAS 50. THE BOYS HAVE FINISHED UNIVERSITY AND WE ARE HAVING GREAT FUN VISITING THEM AND HELPING THEM DEVELOP THEIR LIVES. OUR DAUGHTER STILL LIVES WITH US BUT IS WORKING. WE HAVE MOVED TO A HOUSE IN A NICE VILLAGE. I STILL WORK HARD AND {WIFE} HAS A PART TIME JOB. WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR TIME WITH ADULTS NOW THE BOYS HAVE LEFT. WE ARE NOT SHORT OF MONEY BUT NOT RICH. WE CONTINUE TO TRAVEL ALOT. WE ARE HAPPY.
