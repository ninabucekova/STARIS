			 Sadly, I expect my parents will most likely have passed away during the next ten years. As I still live with them (and rely to some extent on them for my financial security at present) this will mean a vast change in my way of life. I expect I will have to sell the house in which we live and find a more suitable house for a single man. I will probably take the opportunity for a change in job. All this presupposes that I survive for ten years myself! If I suffer a significant personal health scare, I may well have been forced into a rather different lifestyle altogether.
