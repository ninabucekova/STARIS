			 Still playing guitar in pubs/small venues with a band. Watching my two sons also play in bands. Still go walking with friends but keep the "ice ridges" to a minimum Never did get around to the "wet room" but did change the bathroom around Feeling good for 60 still going to the gym when I can, more often now than in previous years.
