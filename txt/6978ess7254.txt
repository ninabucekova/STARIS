			 I am 60 years old. I help out with my grandchildren. I may still be looking after my elderly parents. I hope to be visiting more places throughout Britain and possibly Europe. I hope to be fit enough to enjoy walking and exercise. I may be doing some voluntary work. Hopefully my health will be okay!
