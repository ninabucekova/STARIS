			 I imagine I have improved my work life balance with more life time. I am still cycling regularly & to a good standard (have lost a few miles per hour on 10 years ago) Life still very much revolving around the younger children who are now 15 & 16 & just experiencing what adult life might hold for them. No ambition to reduce but getting greater satisfaction from my working contribution.
