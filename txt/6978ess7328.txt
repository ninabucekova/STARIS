			 I have just retired as a full time nurse & have gone back to work doing two sessions a week whilst drawing my NHS pension. I enjoy my job, having less responsibility than I used to have. I am a season ticket holder at {LOCAL} Football Club & enjoy going to most of the home matches with my husband. I enjoy going on 2-3 holidays a year, still working enables me to do this. I also enjoy soending time with my children & grandchildren. This gives me the most pleasure. I have fewer migraines than I used to have when I was pre-menopausal and still working. I do still get occasional neck & back pain. I worship regularly in our local church & am still part of the music group. I also attend the church fellowship group once a week.
