			 Been married three times first husband I divorced for cruelty and not understanding my health problems. In 1987 I was diagnosed for Multiplesclerosis and he expected me to wait on him hand & foot. Then went back with old boyfriend and got married but year later he died through cancer. I thought my life was over with everything not going my way in life I then met my 3rd husband and have been happily married for over ten years. We live in a terraced house in the suburbs of Birmingham. I started life as a secretary, then went on to be an Administrator in a big firm of accountants and then progressed to be an Finance Assistance in the same company been with them over 25 years. Still employed by them but now on incapacity leave due to my MS getting worse in 2005 and losing my legs for 6 months now walk with crutches or a wheelchair. My main interests are our Garden, cats and my much loved football team 'Birmingham City' and most of all my husband. used to travel around the world but now a days it is harder because of money and my health as I cannot sit still for more that three hours. But most of all I am happy not rich and just have to cope with my illness in my own way and live life to the full.
