			 I imagine that my health, outlook and aspirations will be as much as they are now. The main changes will reflect the fact that my children will be largely grown and leading adult lives. Career wise, my professional life will have moved me towards projects that I enjoy and interest me. Children independent, more time and more disposable income will - I hope - mean more time for my wife and I to do some of the things we have always wanted to do but 'put off' while we have been raising our family. We will have greater time and energy for each other, for romance and to be 'spontaneous'. I would also like to be more involved in doing things to help/benefit others and my community.
