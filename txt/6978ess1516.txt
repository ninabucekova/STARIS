			 I am still married and living in the same house. I play football once a week with the same persons I did at 50. I still go to rock concerts, drink beer at the weekend. I have taken up golf again after a gap of 40 years, and I am playing at least weekly. I enjoy gardening and DIY. I am still working as a environment, health and safety manager. I am very happy and in good health. 2 out of the 3 children have left home, but they still visit regularly.
