			 I am retired from teaching. I may have a part-time job (not teaching!) to keep my brain ticking over and to supplement the pension! I may be doing some voluntary work. I might be looking for a flat to live in. I hope to be making the most of cheaper holidays and avoiding the scorching summer temperatures. Winter sunshine would be particularly welcome (and make me feel better!) I would be walking regularly in the Dales and having long lunches with friends.
