			 I am still working & probably will be till I'm 70! Doing what I don't know! as I write this I hope I am settled in a flat or house without being moved on by greedy landlord, enjoying life as I always have by travelling to foreign shores & feeling free (still not married and no partner) My health is good, knees are playing up but they will hold out for the marathon.... I love my exercise & socializing but must make time to dote on my grandchildren! There is not enough hours in the day to do what I want to do I love life but just need no job and bit more lolly!!! please God I reach 60! PERSONAL
