			 MY INTERESTS ARE MUSIC AND SOCIAL ENTERTAINMENTS, I.E. PUBS WITH LIVE BANDS ETC. I VERY MUCH ENJOY WINE DRINKING. MY HOME LIFE HASN'T CHANGED MUCH IN THE PAST 20 YRS. I AM STILL SINGLE, THOUGH HAVE MANY FRIENDS. I LIVE AT THE SAME PROPERTY ADDRESS AND MUCH TIME IS SPEND REDECORATING AND MODERNISING IT. MY HEALTH OVER THE PAST 8 YEARS HAS NOT BEEN GOOD, MAINLY HEART PROBLEMS. THOUGH THROUGH SURGERY I HOPE TO SOON START LEADING A MORE ACTIVE & FULL LIFE. OBVIOUSLY THERE HAS BEEN GREAT FINANCIAL STRESS AS I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO WORK SINCE 2001 AS A RESULT OF HEALTH PROBLEMS, THOUGH, I MAY SOON BE ABLE TO COMMENCE WORKING LIFE AGAIN. I REMAIN VERY CAUTIOUSLY OPTOMISTIC REGARDING MY FUTURE.
