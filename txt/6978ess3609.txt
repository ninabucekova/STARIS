			 I am not 60, still living with my husband, bless him. Our children, and grandchildren, still live close by, so we see them most days. We are in good health, and keep fit by walking and playing sport once or twice a week. I feel we will both have little part time jobs to make ends meet, and to help pay for our caravan, buy the coast, which we use as often as we can, to get away from it all. This is our little pleasure better than holidays abroad. We have had it for years, and love it. We still have great friends we see for meals, and outings here and at the caravan. I feel very happy. Our grandchildren will all be teenager's and my husband and myself will be married 43 years. Life can't get much better.
