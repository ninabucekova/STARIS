			 Thank goodness I lost that extra weight, why didn't I do it sooner as I feel so much better and my skiing has improved. I'm still going to the gym about 3 times a week to maintain a high fitness level. Cutting down on my work hours has made me so much happier and I've time to do other things such as dog walking for the RSPCA and working at a rabbit rescue. I haven't done as much as I would have liked to by 60yrs of age, but life has been good and I've no regrets. My husband and I have been together almost 35 years and he means more to me now than ever
