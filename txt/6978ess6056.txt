			 I imagine I am retired or semi retired living abroad in the sun with my wife and growing some vegetables/Fruit, taking life at a slower pace but integrated into the community of the area I live in swimming and socialising with friends, playing golf and learning about the culture of the country I now live in. Taking more time for me and my wife to enjoy our life together walking and enjoying our new home together. Which we have looked forward to since we first met and discussed.
