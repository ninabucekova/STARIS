			 I am preparing for retirement and easing off work. My interests are gardening, walking the dog and travelling abroad during school holidays. I live with my wife and near to my children who are settled locally and in successful jobs and relationships. I am fit and healthy. I take regular exercise, though occasionally drink too much. I work as a Headteacher but only part-time as my glittering career is coming to a glorious conclusion!
