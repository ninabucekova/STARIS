			 I am a born again christian, my LORD Jesus Chirst is first in my life. I will be serving him in some way. My son is autistic with learning disabilites and he may still be living with me either full time or weekends and in shared living. I am involved in the local autistic group and I see that involvement growing as the group expands. My health will probably be much the same I have osteo arthritis, psoriatic arthritis & fibromyalgia. I have to pace my days and take each day as it comes. I would like to go back into studying either at the local university or the open university. I hope to be still swimming each week and going out on walks, I enjoy the countryside and the animals and the peace away from the busy city life.
