			 I imagine that I will still be living here and possibly in the same job! More decrepit but hopefully both children happy and healthy possibly with family of their own. (and in their own houses!?) I hope to have travelled more with my husband. Main exercise walking the lakeland fells! Scenario number 2 will be a lottery win (we pisces dream a lot). A house with a big garden in the country and with two dogs (to replace the the children!)
