			 When I'm sixty .. to be honest I find (and have always found!) it hard to make this kind of projection. I really don't spend time thinking about that kind of distant time horizon personally (professionaly I do, but not for myself.) However, if I'm forced: I envisage being in employment (and therefore economically comfortable), probably in health policy / research arena. Home life: probably living with my husband, though depending on work circumstances perhaps we may have two domestic locations (one for me/him during the working week away from "home") Our daughter will be 26. Probably she won't yet have children so I don't envisage we'll move to be near her. That's something we see for our 7th decades! Interests: have decided to start trailing the coastal paths of UK this year. I imagine that will still be something I'm trying to do! And I want to have a way of offering skills to local charity - I imagine committing time to that. Friends will feature as importantly as ever. They will be the core of our social life, as now.
