			 I CONTINUE TO BE SELF-EMPLOYED AND WORK FROM HOME ALTHOUGH HOME IS NOW IN A SEMI-RURAL LOCATION SO I CAN BENEFIT HEALTH & EXCERCISE WISE FROM THE COUNTRY SIDE. WE ARE NOT WELL OFF BUT COMFORTABLE AND FEEL SECURE IN OUR SURROUNDINGS AND RELATIONSHIP. MY ASTHMA HAS NOT WORSENED WITH MY AGE AND I CONTINUE TO BE FIT AND ACTIVE. I HAVE MORE TIME TO INDULGE MY HOBBIES AND LOOK FORWARD TO RETIRING AND TAKING A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN COMMUNITY LIFE.
