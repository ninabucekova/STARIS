			 Although I am now 60 years old, my life is not much different from my life 10 years ago. My mortgage is now paid and I have a pension from the forces which means that I do not have to work as much overtime to maintain my standard of living. I still have the same job but have slowed down a bit because my body is ageing faster that my mind. I intend to work for as long as I can because I believe that retirement will kill me of Boredom!
