			 I am 60 years old and the new business I founded when I was 50 has flourished, providing me at last with the opportunity to retire with no mortgage and some savings. My youngest child is about to enter 6th form and choose a university. My oldest daughter is a Chartered Engineer. I sing for pleasure, read more books and take more holidays (Far flung) than at present. I take courses in creative writing and am learning Chinese, plus do at least 2 exercise classes a week. My partner is still working but we have holidays together and want to buy a house by the sea. I am fit and healthy and make the most of my Freedom Pass in London. I have lots of friends
