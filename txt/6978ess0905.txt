			 ALL THE CHILDREN ARE NOW SETTLED INTO THERE OWN FAMILY LIFE. NOW LIVING IN A BUNGELOW AND MUCH SMALLER - EASY TO MAINTAIN. STILL WORKING AND ENJOYING IT. HAVING PLENTY OF HOLIDAYS AND BREAKS AWAY. HEALTHWISE NOT TOO BAD I SUPPOSE A FEW ACHES AND PAINS - (THE NORM) FOR SOMEONE MY AGE. KEEPING BUSY, LIKE I PREFER BUT STILL HAVING TIME FOR WALKS OUT AND TIME TO SPEND TOGETHER WITH {HUSBAND}. SEEING MY FAMILY REGULAR ITS NICE TO SEE THEM SETTLED AND DOING WELL FOR THEMSELVES. OVERALL ENJOYING LIFE AND HOPEFULLY MANY MORE YEARS TO COME.
