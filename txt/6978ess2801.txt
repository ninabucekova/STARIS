			 I am living on a boat on the Norfolk Broads with a dog and maybe my son, although I think he may have a different plan for his future. I don't have much money but I don't need much. I enjoy being out of the rat race and living the life I have always wanted and not the one everyone else thinks I should be living. Bliss!!
