			 I am still working but hope to retire soon. I have always wanted a dog, & intend to get one as soon as I retire. We have more time to ourselves now our girls are adults & making their way in the world. I walk a lot, do yoga & attend evening classes (I have always wanted to make patch-work quilts & speak French). I have time to experiment in the kitchen & bake a lot. I would like to have the time to do some voluntary work & my husband & I are planning to buy a holiday home abroad.
