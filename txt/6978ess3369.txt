			 In ten year's time I hope that I will still have good health to do the running & cycling that I do now. I hope that I get more in the habit of taking my asthma inhalers - it I don't I will begin to struggle a bit with the breathing. I may have more time for interests such as gardening and travelling as my youngest child will be 24. However I may still have parental involvement in his care as he has some special needs. I may still be at work as I enjoy what I am doing and we have staff over pension age. I will hopefully have more time to spend with my husband. Maybe I will be a grandparent, that would be nice. I may have moved to a smaller house or bungalow - more a decision for me and my husband and not because of schools.
