			 Ive get up by eight. Shower, breakfast and then I contemplate how I am going to spend the day. I am working either in the garden or on the computer or in the kitchen depending on the weather, my UNCLEAR workload, writing or the {COMPANY} venue business, or all of them - there may be a meeting either here or away with clients or prospective clients. I will be spending at least 3 hours writing letters, sending out bills, preparing papers, design statements and drawings, exhibition and concerts. We will normally have our evening meal at home or 'on the hoof' in the {COMPANY} depending on if there's a booking or an evening event. I will UNCLEAR when it's all done. If theres no function on we'll be gardening until it's dark, then reading & cooking. Still no TV and UNCLEAR my blackberry. Bath and bed by 10. On Sunday we'll go to church at least once. Work (if there's a function on) or gardening and church stuff. Will spend 3 weeks in Spain preparing for Christmas business 'long term' planning.
