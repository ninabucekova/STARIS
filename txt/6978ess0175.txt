			 It's just my wife and I at home now. Our daughter has left after getting married. I have more time for tending the garden as I now work part-time as a clerical officer in a local firm based in {PLACE East of England} about two miles away. I need the extra income to top-up my pension. My wife and I are involved in the church that we've attended for some years now although I only preach once a year these days. My main role there is still a Homegroup leader caring and mentoring a small number of the other church members. My health is still good enough to carry out these aforementioned activities. I have again taken up "geriatric" badminton on a weekly basis. It's a full life!
