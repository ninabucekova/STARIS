			 When I am 60 I very much hope to have moved house /area and substantially reduced my work hours. My house sale fell through recently (along with 1000's of others) and that was my opportunity to down size and leave my current employment. Hopefully, I will have managed this within the next ten years. Neither of my boys have a stable / long term relationship the 'go' but by the time I'm 60, I hope to be a 'yummy' grandma. It would be nice to have a male partner and I would not be adverse to marriage again - who knows! so quite a few welcome changes ahead!
