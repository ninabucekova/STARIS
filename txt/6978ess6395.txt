			 I like to imagine that I'm retired, still in good health, active and enjoying the opportunity for travel, walking, being outdoors, gardening and growing vegetables, in the company of my life partner, {PARTNER}, who is also well, active and happy. I hope I would continue with academic projects, my research into women's writing, maintaining contract with students. Hopefully, too, there will be more time for friends and for family - though I am sorry to think there will be losses here as we age.
