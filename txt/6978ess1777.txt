			 I hope that my husband and I will be able to retire. I would hope to keep in touch with old colleagues/friends, continue socialising with friends and family, go out dancing, continue to go for country walks/hikes, travel abroad, have weekends away. Enjoy night school classes (Italian) I enjoy painting and drawing. Maybe my sons will be married and have children of their own! If my parents are still alive I may be helping to care for them. I intend to spend a few months of the year at our apartment in {PLACE Europe} - where we have made many Italian friends. Hoping I will continue to be in good health -(if a little stiff!)
