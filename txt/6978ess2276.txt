			 I am still working but only have a couple of years to go until retirement. My daughter is doing her GCSEs so we are still very busy. We are getting together with the boys over Chirstmas and going skiing still in the February half term. It is good to see them making their own way in the world. I am looking forward to the summer holidays and seeing all the family in France as usual. I get some aches and pains but nothing that stops me from enjoying an active life.
