			 I AM 60 YEARS OLD AND I AM STILL WORKING AT {WORKPLACE University} AND HAVE BEEN FOR NEARLY 41 YEARS, I MAY THINK ABOUT RETIRING EARLY, HOPEFULLY MY WIFE AND I WILL STILL BE VISITING OUR LOCAL PUBS FOR A DRINK AND A BITE TO EAT, I HOPE WE WILL BE FIT & HEALTHY TO DO THIS. ALSO TO GO ON HOLIDAYS WITH MY SON AND HIS WIFE AND KIDS, WOULD BE NICE.
