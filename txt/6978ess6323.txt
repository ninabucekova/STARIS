			 I am still working as a vetinary surgeon. I have moved back into my parents' home since they both died. I am fine, and enjoy walking around the village where I grew up. I often visit my sister, and her son, on their farm two miles away. My daughter is a doctor in a hospital in London. She visits me when time allows I enjoy gardening.
