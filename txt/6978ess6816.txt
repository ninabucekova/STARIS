				 National Child Development Study: Sweep 8, 2008-2009 
		 
			 I have finally retired on a very good pension, this enables my husband and myself to have several holidays a year. Both my children are settled and are happy in their working lives. I do voluntary work at the local Maternity Hospital. 1 day a week I find this quite fulfilling. My health could be better my joints are a little stiff and my blood pressure continues to be a problem. We continue to visit National Trust homes, and find it easier because we can now visit in the week when it is a little quieter.
