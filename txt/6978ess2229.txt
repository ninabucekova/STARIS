			 My interest haven't changed much since I was 50. My grandsons are very important to me and enjoying watching them grow up. I love reading and find it very relaxing. My health now is better since I gave up smoking, though put on a bit of weight. I still work a couple of days a week in the same job and enjoying it. Home life: Nothing much has changed. My sisters visit often for meals, and I see quite a lot of my family.
