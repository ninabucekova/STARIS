			 Being 60 years old and retired is much better than spending a life as a P.E. teacher working in an enviroment where the management possess few morals and set few standards for one to admire. I feel I have earned my retirement. I am living abroad for a number of months throughout the year. I regret not finding a partner early in life and having children. Meeting the right person at the right time did elude me and I felt let down by certain individuals during my life. But I had determination to succeed instilled through my close relationship with my mother. At work / professional life was influenced by other individuals. I succeeded most by doing things on my own and my determination to be successful!
