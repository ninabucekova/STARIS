			 I imagine that I will still be working and imagining how it will be in five years time! I will be a grandmother several times over and enjoying the experience. I imagine that weekends will be spent enjoying the countryside and playing some pitch and putt. I am well now and hope that my good health will continue. As indicated in this survey, I have very little imagination but I am optimistic about the future - I am re-marrying again in December and I'm looking forward to spending happy days with my new husband.
