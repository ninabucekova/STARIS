			 I cannot see myself retiring ever. We all know how bad pensions have done in the last 10-15 years and I can't see them any getting better. We have a mortgage where for the first ten years I was the only one working full time and some of this was 15% interest. Both our children went to university over a five year period this wiped out any money we had saved but worth every penny. Money will be the key to our future. This country never thinks of the born and bred working man. I cannot see much change in my future. I don't think we will move (no point). I have always kept myself fit hopefully I always will. My interests may have to change in the future because of financial reasons.
