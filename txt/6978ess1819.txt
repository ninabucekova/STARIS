			 My life is very similar to the way it was when I was younger. I have the same interests and hobbies. I like to go for walks with my husband, who will be 65 this year (2018) and looking forward to his retirement. We have enjoyed long friendships and continue to meet for meals and visit them. My health is good and I like to garden and sew. I have stopped working now in order to spend more time with my elderly parents.
