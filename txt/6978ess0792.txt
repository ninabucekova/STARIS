			 I am keeping active through my hobby of vegetable gardening, and also propagation of flowers and vegetables from seeds. My success with seeds has been reasonably good over the years which is extremely rewarding, long may this continue to be the case. I may still be living in my parents home (unsure about this), as it is located close to the sea, with some refreshing walks along the cliffs only 5 minutes away.

I am now employed with a local company in {PLACE}, involved in computer work, and my job requires a 15 minute walk to the building, very convenient with no travelling time involved.
