			 Hopefully I will BE RETIRED, 6 MONTHS IN THE SUN 6 MONTHS AT HOME. WE CAN ALL DREAM, I Will PROBABLY BE WORKING PART TIME IN A SUPERMARKET AS THEY ARE THE ONLY COMPANY'S WHO EMPLOY OLD FOGEY'S. Hopefully I WILL BE HEALTHY & HAPPY STILL LIVING WHERE I AM NOW, WITH DOGS & CATS TO KEEP ME BUSY, PLENTY of WALKING TO KEEP ME FIT, PROBABLY WITH NO MONEY TO SPARE AS THE ANIMALS WILL SEE TO THAT. BUT WiTH PLENTY of PEOPLE TO CHAT TO WALKING THE DOGS. IN THIS VILLAGE EVERYBODY OWNS A DOG YOU CAN SPEND AN HOUR CHATTING ON A TEN MINUTE WALK. (PERHAPS I WONT GET VERY FIT)
