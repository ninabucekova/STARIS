			 Children gron up now but we still see them every day. Wife and myself have more time to enjoy our interests of travelling and boating. Still involved in running my own business but taking less of an active day to day role. Health been good although I am not as active now as five years ago, but still very young in mind. In general I can't complain have worked hard and achived a lot of what I wanted.
