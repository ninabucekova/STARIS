			 At 60 I will have retired from teaching. Hopefully, I will still be experiencing good health & be fit & active. I would probably have stopped playing netball(!) & may have taken up golf more seriously. I would also like to think that I had enough money to travel, go on walking & skiing holidays & I want to learn to sail. It would be great to have grandchildren & to have the time to spend with them doing fun things. I may have some sort of job - not sure. In the village we have talked about buying a plot of land for a small cooperative. Growing fruit & veg, keeping animals. Would be great to get that off the ground. There are lots of things I want to do & places I want to visit but at the moment time is always a restriction. I look forward to having more free time.
