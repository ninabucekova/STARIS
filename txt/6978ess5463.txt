			 I imagine I'll still be teaching french at Primary level + continue to be very involved in my local babtist church. I may be doing some voluntary work. I'll still be married + hopefully seeing future grandchildren regularly. I think my body will have become stiffer, despite doing Pilates classes + swimming. I hope I'll still go scuba diving once a year with my husband. There is also a possibility that we might have emigrated to Sydney!
