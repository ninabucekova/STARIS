			 I visit my children and Grandchildren on a regular basis. I can take holidays with my husband when I want as we have both retired from work. We lead a busy life with the Church and enjoy Weekends away with friends. My health is holding its own and medication is still keeping my Asthma in check although I am now on tablets and inhalers. My arthritis is still a problem but does not stop me doing many things. I lead a full life which I still share with my husband of 41 years.
