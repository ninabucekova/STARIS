			 When I am 60 I expect to have either retired or work part-time, say 3 days a week, or perhaps do some occasional consultancy work.I do not expect to live in my current home but to have moved somewhere easier to manage. I hope to have a dog and be more in control of my health. I cannot predict whether my main relationship will still survive, but I expect to continue with most of my friendships and probably spend more time together. I would expect to see less of my family as they are a lot older than me and will probably not live that long. My father has already died and Mum is over 90.
