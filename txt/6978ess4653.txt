			 I hope to be playing golf and exercising regularly. Spending some time in France and in the U.K. Maybe some voluntary work. Healthwise, who knows, but well I hope. My son will be 28 I doubt he will have children by then but maybe married. My husband will be retired and we will be spending more time together. Maybe sell the house in {PLACE} and by a flat more centrally so if we wish to spend time in France we can close up easily here.
