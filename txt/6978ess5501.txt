			 I am working one day a week. I am spending time in our second home, walking & climbing hills. I am spending a few months each year in Greece. My health will be generally good though I'll have more knee problems and less energy/strength. Things will by much tighter financially - I'll be looking for bargains Life will become even less dependant on others - I'll have less friends, less family contact etc . I may start another degree with OU.
