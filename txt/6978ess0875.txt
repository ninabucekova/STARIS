			 Still working full time to support my children now 23 & 21 and to enjoy a fulfilling life of socialising & travel. I enjoy weekends away, cinema, theatre, enjoy walking cycling & social groups. I have a lovely comfortable, tidy and modern home. No mortgage, no debts. My health - still suffering with lung infections in the winter. Enjoy my children and see them very often - hopefully still living at home. I have lots of friends.
