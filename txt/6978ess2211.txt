			 OK. Here I am, not quite retired but able to do so in the next 3-4 years and then can pick & choose a few hours more in the hospital / community clinics (as a midwife). Plenty of time now for making & painting belly-pots (pregnant women's tummies) and getting my website {WEBSITE} up & running. Great to have all the angst of my 50's 'midlife crisis' behind us & {HUSBAND} & me (my husband) trotting alongside each other, having a laugh & taking the ol' campervan away at weekends. Money enough to get to see {DAUGHTER} & {PARTNER} (daughter & partner) & their children in Australia and catch up with {SON} UNCLEAR his jaunts (my son is currently travelling the world and I think he probly won't settle down afterwards). Feeling good - few creaky joints & expensive trips to the dentist but have a great osteopath to keep me in tune.
