			 I'm still working, but planning my retirement. I'm still running and swimming. Recently, I took up yoga and will continue doing this as long as possible. Occasionally, I see my children & grandchildren. My health is very good - perhaps one or two painful joints but nothing major. My home life if happy, although I'm worried about my husband, whose health is failing. I qualified a few years ago as a UNCLEAR Teacher, and will continue to teach Drama for the foreseeable future. I enjoy going to Church - maybe once or twice a week.
