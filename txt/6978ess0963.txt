			 I have a retired from work and enjoy being a Grandma. We now also have the time and freedom to go on holidays whenever we wish to. I can also rest my sore ankles and feet which were caused by too much standing in one place at work. It would be nice to do some voluntary work every now and again, to help others and give me an extra interest.
