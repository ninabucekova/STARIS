			 I have sold my company well but have been retained in an advisory role. I spend most of my time on our farm in the country (which I love) and come up to London 2 days per week to see friends or go to the theatre/exhibitions etc. I retain a couple of non-exec roles which keeps me interested in business. My son is at University and my Daughter doing her 'A' levels. Holidays and time with them is important and I love seeing them and love their company. My wife and I take many short breaks away. We are very happy and still in good shape.
