			 At 60 yrs I hope to be retired but have a part time job to keep me active and meeting people. I want to continue to be healthy and continue with my swimming, keep fit classes & Yoga. In home life, I hope to move with my husband to live near the sea, south coast, as we both enjoy sailing and my husband would like to buy a boat and sail in his retirement. I hope to be able to support and be there for both my children to help and advise them as they both go through their University Years. I work in the NHS and would be happy to work P/T back in the service, if this is not possible, perhaps get involved in Voluntary services with Macmillan or Citizens advice.
