			 By the time I reach 60 I would hope that I have retired and am able to live comfortably. My husband and I would enjoy an active time walking, gardening and socialising. I would hope that my two children would be happily married and possibly have produced some grandchildren! I would hope that my health was still good and did not prevent me from doing the things I wish to do. We have an apartment in the French Alps and I would hope that we are able to continue to visit and enjoy the mountain life.
