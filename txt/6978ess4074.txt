			 I am celebrating my 60th birthday with My husband children and grandchildren, all my family and friends are in the house and I feel very loved & special. All my colleagues at work have joined in aswell and wondering if I'm going to retire from nursing. Still actively involved in going to church and signed up for recreational night classes and working in the garden. My health could be better but on the whole I think i'm wearing well and nobody believes im "60"
