			 I am retired and enjoying life after working all my life in the Insurance Industry. I have sold my buisness and enjoying the fruits of my labour, I spend alot of my time at our home in France & a great deal of time exploring different parts of the world not seen due to previous workloads. I am very healthy & enjoy playing the occasional game of Badminton & plenty of leisurely walks with my husband.
