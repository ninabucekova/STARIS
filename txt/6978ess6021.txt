			 I WOULD LIKE TO BE STILL WORKING. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE LOST WEIGHT & TAKEN UP A PASTTIME SUCH AS GOLF WHICH WILL KEEP ME OCCUPIED AND WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT MY WIFE AND I COULD SHARE. BEING REASONABLE COMFORTABLE FINANCIALLY WOULD BE GOOD. HOPEFULLY MY SON WILL BE HAPPY AND SUCCESSFUL IN HIS CAREER AND HIS LIFE GENERALLY. WHETHER HE WAS MARRIED OR HAD CHILDREN WOULD NOT BE AS IMPORTANT AS KNOWING THAY HE HAD SOMEONE WHO LOVED HIM AND THAT HE LOVED HIM. I WOULD LIKE TO TRAVEL MORE AND SEE PLACES THAT I COULD NOT AFFORD TO GO TO WHEN I WAS YOUNGER. I DEFINITELY WANT TO STILL LOVE AND BE LOVED BY MY WIFE.
