			 At age 60, my daughter will be 27. Maybe she lives nearby, and plans to have a family soon, in which I hope to be included and involved. I will be continuing my work as a Gardener, reducing the hours I work to a sustainable amount. Hopefully the majority of my family and friends will still be alive, and we will be continuing to support each other emotionally and physically when necessary. I plan to continue what I enjoy now; reading, cinema, some TV, some Internet, theatre, the occasional trip to London for art, and my allotment!
