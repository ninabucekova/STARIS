			 WELL I HAVE MADE IT TO GO & THAT IS A PRIVELAGE AS MANY HAVE NOT. I AM WELL ESTABLISHED WITHIN MY CAREER AS A DESIGNER & THE WORK LOAD & TYPE OF WORK HAVE BALANCE & I HAVE CONTROL. MY FAMILY ARE ALL WELL & I SEE THEM A LOT NOW. MUM & DAD ARE WELL. I HAVE MORE FRIENDS THAN WHEN I WAS 50 & HAVE AN ACTIVE & FULFILLING SOCIAL LIFE. I DID LEARN TO PLAY THE PIANO IN THE END I AM FINANCIALLY SECURE, I SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH FAMILY, FRIENDS & OTHERS, I TRAVEL A LOT. I DON'T WORRY SO MUCH ABOUT MY FAILINGS. I HAVE LEASURE TIME & USE IT WELL. I STILL HAVE ALL MY OWN TEETH & EVERY BODY LAUGHS AT MY JOKES (ONLY JOKING)
