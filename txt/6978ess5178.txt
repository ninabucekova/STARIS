			 I hope that when I am 60 my life will be pretty much as it is now. Still happy with my husband, still in my job as a school librarian, still playing the trumpet in the orchestra. My life would improve if I have some grandchildren by then. I guess I will be a bit slower at doing things but I hope not too much.
