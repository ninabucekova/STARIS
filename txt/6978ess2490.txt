			 At 60 years old I hope that my husband & I are in a position to have retired. I wish to travel with my husband or friends (would doubt if I was a widow that I could do it on my own). Possibly I may have grandchildren and hopefully can take part in their life. However if none come along wont pressurise my son as I believe the country/world isn't a child friendly place. With regard to health I hope to continue without any major problems but realise general aches & pains will develop with age.
