			 I believe 60 is the new 50, so I just get on with living. I have a few stiff joints, but it doesnt really stop me doing stuff, it just takes a bit longer. I can laugh at my bad memory or weak bladder, its better than dwelling on them. I laugh when my grandson says "come on nanna, as he is climbing hills and he thinks I am 20 years old" its priceless.
