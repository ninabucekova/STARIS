			 Life is so busy. I am still working at the school & throughly enjoying it. My weekly Pilates and swimming keep my body & spirits fit and sometimes I even cycle down by the canal. Planning & preparing for visits from the children and grandchildren during the holidays keeps me content, and we regularly visit family & friends. Once a fortnight I commit time to the homeless charity and still manage time for my creative art classes. Fortunately, my husband is retired so he now does much more of the household chores, giving me the time to do more interesting things. Any day now I will be having my replacement knee op - the last one lasted longer than we thought.
