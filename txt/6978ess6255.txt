			 I FEEL I AM HAPPY WITH MY LIFE. I HAVE A GREAT LOVING PARTNER, 2 GREAT KIDS. MY HEALTH IS VERY GOOD. I LOVE MY WORK TOO. I TRY AND KEEP FIT. THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME. LOVE RUNNING GOING TO GYM. THESE I DO 4-5 TIMES A WEEK. MONEY WISE NOT A LOT BUT WE DO OK. LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING 2 WEEKS HOLIDAY A YEAR. MY FRIENDS ARE ALSO IMPORTANT TO ME. EITHER HAVING NIGHTS IN OR DOWN AT THE PUB. ALL IN ALL. VERY SATICEFIED WITH MY LIFE.
