			 I live with my Husband {HUSBAND}, by the seaside. {HUSBAND} is retired but does voluntary work as do I. My children have left home with places of their own and have acheived their dream careers and are happy in their work and personal relationships. I love my gardening and teaching Alternative Therapies, and my pilates keeps me fit and flexible. {HUSBAND} and I have at least three holidays a year and enjoy each others company. We do not own our own home but that makes no difference, we have each other and we have {DAUGHTER} and {SON} who we love dearly.
