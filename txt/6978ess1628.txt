			 I have just retired from work. I have recently moved to a different area and down-sized. I have reasonable health, but like to walk and keep fit. I eat sensibly but do enjoy a glass of wine and a bar of chocolate. sometimes. I love going to the theatre to see various show and live acts. I am a grandmother and enjoy babysitting and looking after the children sometimes, but not on a full-time basis. I have a great relationship with my husband, who is my best friend and still makes me laugh. We intend to have several holidays each year.
