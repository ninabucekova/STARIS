			 I probably will still be working in banking/mortgage related as I really enjoy my job most of the time. I hope we still have our horses & dogs & still have my health to enjoy the activities we do today with them. I hope we are still involved with the local riding club as we have many friends there. I hope my health is still good & body not too creaky!
