			 I am still married to my wonderful husband, our home is the same. Kept clean and tidy with a new back door? we still have our dogs. Hopefully the mortgage is paid off. We are not in debt and can afford to live a comfortable life I am now working part time, which gives me time to see friends & family and doing voluntary work - for others which I enjoy - I try to look after health & fitness and enjoy working in the garden - and walking our dogs. I am taking time to learn new skills, courses. I am working with children - special needs part-time. I am enjoying my life and my home and having time to relax and help others. Heres hopeing, But life is what you make it !
