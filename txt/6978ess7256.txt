			 AT AGE 60 I CANNOT SEE ANY ASPECT OF MY LIFE BEING DIFFERENT TO MY PRESENT SITUATION. MY DAUGHTER WILL HAVE PROBABLY LEFT HOME. I WILL OWE LESS ON THE MORTGAGE BUT BE PAYING MORE TOWARDS MY RETIREMENT. I WILL KNOW BETTER IF I WILL BE ABLE TO RETIRE AT 65 OR IF I WILL NEED TO DO SOME PAID WORK BEYOND 65. I HOPE MY HEALTH WILL STILL BE GOOD & THAT I WILL STILL ENJOY ALL THAT I DO AT PRESENT. IF I AM AS HAPPY THEN AS I AM NOW I WILL BE SATISFIED.
