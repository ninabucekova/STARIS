			 As a civil servant at age 60 I would have just retired. I would have hoped to buy a second property abroad, probably in French Alps. Retirement has allowed me to spend far more time walking, mountaineering and painting. My wife has also finished work, my eldest son has graduated and is now employed as a freelance scriptwriter. My youngest son has completed an apprentiship and is married with one child. My health is good, my pension allows me to do anything within reason I need to, and life seems fine.
