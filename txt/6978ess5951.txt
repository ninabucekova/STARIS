			 By the time I am 60 years old I hope to have retired from part-time work as a CAD Operator but would still be happy to work part-time doing a less stressful job. Hopefully our daughter will be married with children and live close by if that is her choice, though as long as she is happy and healthy we will be glad. With the help of drugs I hope my health will stay at the same level (which is good at present) and will not decrease. Hopefully my husband and I will be able to spend more time at our home in the Lakes doing the many walks we keep planning but have no time to do at the moment. Though its a big ask I would still like my parent to be around (Dad would be 90 and mum 85) I appreciate how lucky I am as my husband has lost both his parents. At 60 my husband and I hope to spend more time travelling around Great Britain seeing placed I have been wanting to and making good use of our National Trust memberships, and to overcome my fear of flying to travel the world. I hope to become a more accomplished gardener and decorator, I would love to learn some alternative therapies. Hopefully we will still have a large circle of family and friends.
