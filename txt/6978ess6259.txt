			 I hope when I am 60 that I have enough money to reduce or cease working. Be able to still enjoy foreign travel. Enjoy several holidays a year. I may feel that I want to downsize the size of my house for something requiring less maintenance. When I am 60 my youngest son will be 20 & the eldest 30 I hope that the eldest will be happy independent & in a relationship & have made me a granny, & that the youngest will be at university. I hope that I have some time to enjoy hobbies & most of all I hope that my husband is still with me & that we are all healthy.
