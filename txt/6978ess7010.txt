			 I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT I'M IN A PART TIME JOB WITH MORE TIME TO SPEND WITH ANY GRANDCHILDREN I MAY HAVE, TO HELP MY DAUGHTERS BRING THEM UP, AND TO BE ABLE TO TRAVEL MORE AROUND THE WORLD NOT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT MONEY, OR ANY ILL HEALTH. AND TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH MY PARENT'S AS THEY GET OLDER. I DON'T WANT TO BE IN FULL TIME WORK TILL I'M 65 I FEEL THAT LIFE IS TO SHORT TO HAVE TO SPEND MORE TIME WORKING THAN NOT.
