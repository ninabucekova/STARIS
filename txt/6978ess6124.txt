			 I imagine that my life at 60 will be very similar to my life at 50. Perhaps I will be working only on a self employed basis from home and choosing more what and how I work. I still hope to be with my partner and have more time to share together doing the things we enjoy: basically I hope life will be less pressured. I suppose it is very likely I will be a Grandma by that age and that is another stage of life I look forward to. I intend to keep as fit as possible and hope I will still be healthy.
