			 I feel that I could possibly be working part-time when I am 60 but I may change my mind. I can't see a lot of change happening with my social life. I may possibly go out more and maybe take a few more holidays. By the time I am 60 all my children will have finished their education. I don't envisage that any of my children will move far away. I certainly hope not. I am concerned about still smoking at 50 as I feel it will effect my health as I get older. I would like to start swimming to keep myself active. I don't think I will be worried about my financial situation as my husband has a very good pension !!
