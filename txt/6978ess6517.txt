			 I AM NOW RETIRED ALONG WITH MY WIFE. WE GO ON HOLIDAY A COUPLE OF TIMES A YEAR AND ENJOY WALKING, MOST DAYS. WE ARE BOTH IN FAIRLY GOOD HEALTH AND I CAN STILL CARRY OUT MY DIY JOBS THAT ARE REQUIRED. WE SEE OUR FAMILIES ON A FAIRLY REGULAR BASIS AND THE GRANDCHILDREN COME OVER AND STAY. I STILL PLAY A LITTLE GOLF AND LOOK AFTER THE GARDEN. I THINK WE MAY MOVE SOON AS OUR HOUSE IS REALLY TO BIG FOR JUST THE TWO OF US.
