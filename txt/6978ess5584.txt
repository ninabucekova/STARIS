			 I continue to enjoy my work as it remains a daily challenge looking after the needs of international students working with the Royal Navey. My work as the commanding officer of the Volunteer Cadet Corps continues at the same pace as before. Still very enjoyable watching the cadets mature through their years within the cadets. Home and well being are as in previous years. I still love my wife, of 14 years and the Grandchildren keep me busy and fit. Gardens and allotment also keep me in rude health.
