			 Music and singing are a major part of my life which I enjoy continuing. I love to visity the theatre, opera, ballet and cinema productions and visiting as many galleries and concerts as possible. I have a busy home life with my husband and children and grandchildren, other family members and friends. I have reasonable health and try to keep as active as possible to avoid going into hospital - I take as much time out for a good, long walk. I would not expect to be working in a paid capacity as I have been the main carer for my two children and take part in school activities as a parent helper and worked part-time and as a volunteer at church and in the local community which I enjoy still.
