			 I am counting the years, five to be precise, until I can finally retire. I feel burnt out, exhausted and very concerned about whether I can keep up with such a demanding career. The pressure is immense to maintain the pace and enthusiasm which ten years ago was a struggle; now is overwhelming and my mind is not as quick and cannot respond to day-to-day challenges as it did when I was 50, Dismissal? Maybe.. My career has consumed my personal life; a very poor work-life balance has ensured too little time to relax and enjoy the birth of my first grandchild. I feel I have let my daughter down and also have been denied the pleasures of caring for this baby due to imposed requirement for me to remain working. My daughter has to return to work and leave our flesh and blood with a stranger as I cannot afford an early retirement. I feel bitter. I feel angry that I will be 73 years old, if I can make it til then, before my husband retires when we may finally enjoy some quality and precious time as man and wife, and as good parents to our one and only daughter.
