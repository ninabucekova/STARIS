			 I hope I can retire at 60. Although having been born after "1952" I don't get a state pension until I am 65. I also hope that there is some new medication which will help my bladder condition. If this is the case I want to try to enjoy a few years of my life doing other things. If I can't afford to retire I would just work a few less hours per week until I am 65.
