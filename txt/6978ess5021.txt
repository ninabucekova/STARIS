			 I enjoy my life at 60. At 50 times were emotionally difficult since my husband left me for another woman. The trauma to me and my family was unbearable. At 60 my life has changed. I am secure again. The house is now in my name. I cope so much better and enjoy my life. I still work as a Practice Nurse and enjoy all the challenges in a job that has brought me so much satisfaction. I enjoy running still and have very good health. I love the theatre and socialising with my friends. My faith and church are a huge part of my life and much of what I do and who I am revolves around that. My relationship with my son & daughter is good and settled. Most of all I am at peace as the hate & bitterness & betrayal of my husband leaving has now eased.
