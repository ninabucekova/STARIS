			 I imagine that when I am 60 years old I will be living on my own perhaps in a flat I know I will always have the love and help of my 2 daughters I hope too still be following my interests in walking especially with a dog and reading and sewing I hope to still be working definitely on a part-time basis then. I know I could never stop working (I find it keeps my healthy and happy)
