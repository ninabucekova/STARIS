			 In 2018 I will probably be working at the same place, as I have been there since leaving school. I hope my leisure time will have increased, having nice holidays and playing more golf. My daughter will be 19, so will be starting to have a life of her own. So my wife and I can have some speciel time together. I hope my health stays at a nice level so I can enjoy life and my family, as I have done in the past.
