			 If Im 60 yrs old I hope that I've lost my weight to feel fitter & healthier so that I can still pot around my garden and be able to pick things up with out any aches and pains. That I'm still healthy enough to be around and watch my grand children grow up. Life's to short to worry about work Maybe the new generation should be out there working and giving the old un's a chance to enjoy what life might be left for them to enjoy. But all I see is the older one's keeps working while the young one's Don't want to. And there just No Discipline Anymore. So how can younger People respect things, when its all been taken away & made easy for them.
