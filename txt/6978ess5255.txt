			 NOW I HAVE TURNED 60, I HAVE CHANGED MY SPORTING INTERESTS FROM PLAYING TO WATCHING. I STILL GO TO CELTIC PARK EVERY SECOND SATURDAY. BUT UNFORTUNATELY AS MOST OF MY BADMINTON PLAYING FRIENDS HAVE RETIRED OR PASSED AWAY MY CLUB HAS STOPPED. I AM, HOWEVER CONSIDERING TAKING UP BOWLES? I AM STILL MARRIED & IN LOVE, AND ENJOY THE COMPANY OF MY CHILDREN & THEIR CHILDREN. THE SAD THING IS THE AMOUNT OF FUNERAL'S I ATTEND AS MY AUNTS & UNCLES ARE REACHING THE END OF THEIR LIVES. I AM STILL IN CHILD-CARE & I HAVE OBTAINED A MANAGER'S POSITION & I STILL DO A LITTLE DRIVING INSTRUCTION. MY HEALTH IS MUCH THE SAME, BUT I CANNOT TAKE PART IN SPORT AS I AM SLOWER & TEND TO TAKE MORE TIME TO RECOVER. I CAN SEE RETIREMENT COMING IN 5 YEARS. BUT I THINK I WILL KEEP THE DRIVING INSTRUCTION ON AS A HOBBY.
