			 My children are happy and in good stable relationships and can talk to me about anything but are not totally dependent on me. My husband still loves me - aaahh - and I love him. My mother is OK. My entire family has moved to live next door to me. We are all healthy and see a lot of each other. My jobs got better, I work for a fulfilling charity. No money worries - in fact I can give money to my friends. Everyone is happy & smiley & John Sergeant is a top judge on Strictly. Wine & Hula Hoops are not fattening. The bags under my eyes have magically gone. I am in control of the garden & an automatic hoover which also irons has been invented. Everyone is happy - no war, no cutting down rain forests. It's all fantastic!!!!
