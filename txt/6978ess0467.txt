			 I FIND THIS VERY DIFFICULT! I HOPE I WILL BE IN BETTER HEALTH, ABLE TO GO WALKING IN THE COUNTRYSIDE & IDEALLY LEAD AS NORMAL LIFE AS POSSIBLE, HAVE SOME SORT OF JOB PROBABLY OFFICE BASED AS I USED TO, ANYTHING WOULD BE MARVELLOUS TO BE ABLE TO DO. I WOULD LIKE TO GO BACK TO DANCING, SOCIALISING WITH FRIENDS & GOING TO THEATRE & EVENTS. (I HOPE BUT I CANNOT 'EXPECT' WITH MY LIKELY PROGNOSIS. I MAY STILL BE VERY RESTRICTED BUT I HOPE I WILL STILL BE ABLE TO ENJOY READING & SMALLER HOME BASED PLEASURES & MANAGE MY SELF & HOME ADMIN AS NOW, & HAVE OCCASIONAL OUTINGS WITH HELP AS NOW. I WILL BE HAPPY IF I CAN MAINTAIN WHAT I HAVE NOW BUT OF COURSE WOULD MUCH BETTER RATHER BE WELL & ABLE.)
