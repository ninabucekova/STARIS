			 In robust health & still quite sporty, playing tennis, golf & skiing. I hope to be still married & very happy and close to my sons & their partners. I would be happy to be working (part-time) & enjoying seeing our friends & family, eating out & having more time to pursue the opera/theatre/cinema/ art galleries. It would be nice to still holiday with the children sometimes. I would like to have time for voluntary/charity work. With regards to work I will not be doing my current job with its extensive travelling, but I'd do some consultancy work or something with my husband. My husband & I would be travelling more extensively though. I dont see myself as a lady who lunches, but if our sons had children I imagine my husband and I would enjoy our grandchildren
