			 At 60 I would hope that my 2 children will be in steady and stable relationships an also be in regular employment. If this is the case I will not have to support them financially an in other ways as to the level I do now. This will allow me the time to persue my interests of dog showing and horse riding which I do not have time for at present. I hope to have stopped smoking and therefore reap the benefits healthwise. With regards to work I would consider early retirement if it was financially feasible but in reality I think that I will still be working full time.
