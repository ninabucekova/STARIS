			 NOW RETIRED FROM WORK 5 YEARS. TRYING TO CONTINUE HELPING FAMILY. (HOPEFULLY GRANDCHILDREN!) MY JOINTS CONTINUE TO GIVE ME DISCOMFORT AND CAN BE RESTRICTIVE IN THAT I AM NOT ABLE TO DO SO MUCH AS I USED TO DO. I AM NOT WORKING AT ALL NOW AND AM CONTENTED WITH THIS, AS I DO NOT HAVE THE SAME STRESSORS IN LIFE. NOW ENJOYING MORE TRAVEL & HOLIDAYS THAN EVER BEFORE.
