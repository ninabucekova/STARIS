			 At 60 I would hope to be enjoying retirement with my husband, secure in the knowledge that my children are supporting themselves adequately and my parents are also receiving any care and support they may need. It's likely however that our desire to travel, take extended ski-holidays and attend sporting events, will be tempered by the need to continue to support both parents and children. I would hope our health is good enough to enable us to take up walking again, ski and swim. Any work undertaken would be strictly as a result of financial necessity and would probably relate to educational provision/consultancy, but not class teaching. I would like to imaging myself experiencing a sense of freedom that the constraints of work have inhibited for many, many years.
