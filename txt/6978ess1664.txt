			 Still working at the same job though hopefully not as hard. Youngest child has finally left home Walking the dogs Social/family life as busy as it is now and hopefully more so. A little more time away from work Eyesight a bit worse, joints aching a little more and a few less teeth. My biggest worry I imaging would be financial security for retirement due to decreasing pension & rising cost of living.
