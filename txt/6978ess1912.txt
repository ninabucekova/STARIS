				 National Child Development Study: Sweep 8, 2008-2009 
		 
			 I would like to have retired perhaps have a couple of dogs to go walking with. I love the fresh air and countryside. Perhaps look after any grandchildren, if they need childcare. Found a soul mate to share interest and hobbies. but have a nice family & friends to keep me busy. Just to enjoy life & be happy.
