			 Interests: I only learnt to read for pleasure in my 50's so I read a lot. In addition I enjoy gardening, walking, visiting places of interest & beauty (my partner and I have been members of National Trust for many years) and observing wildlife - particularly birds. I attend Church now which is something I didn't do when I was younger. I have a close knit group of female friends and I meet with them monthly. I am always have something on the go for myself such as an evening class or making something â€¦ Home Life: I am still with my partner. We are still living in the same area. I am worried about money, my pension and I'm looking for ways to economise. My partner and I don't have any children and we spend a lot of time together. My parents are still alive but they are ailing and they are a constant concern for me. By brother and sister are able to give my parents good practical and financial care whereas I seem to have more time and give emotional care. My siblings & their families live fairly close and I spend time with them; we get along better now that we have ever done. Health & Well Being: I feel well emotionally, socially and intellectually but not necessarily physically. I do yoga and walk as often as I can, mainly in the summer, but I know that my health is deteriorating; I am still overweight and not as fit as I should be, I am aware of the impact this has on my health and I expect it to get worse particularly affecting my back and knees. I am worried about my health but I am complacent. Work: I am working as Counsellor and enjoying it very much; I retrained when I was 50 and it still feels new and challenging; this time I have the confidence of life experience and maturity; I am still enjoying studying and continuing to invest in my 'second' career. I work part time as an employee and privately; I am comfortable in my work; I fee competent, self confident and able to assert myself.
