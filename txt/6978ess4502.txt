			 As my two youngest daughters will only be 21 I cannot see much changing in the next ten years. If the economic conditions allow I would like to sell my company and change my job to possibly allow more leisure time. Hopefully my health will continue to allow me to be reasonable active, and I would like to have more holidays, and time with my family. With four daughters I would like to achieve some financial security in order to work when I want to.
