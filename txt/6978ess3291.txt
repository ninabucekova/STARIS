			 Mainly I hope that I'm still here to fill this form in as a 60 year old. My health is good but I am overweight, have slightly high blood pressure, an underactive thyroid and because of long hours working in highly pressurised job, a fear of a heart attack having had both parents suffer heart problems. I imagine I will still be working (health allowing) in the same demanding job. In ten years time our children will be 32 and 28 and I hope to be a Grandparent and spending as much time as possible being a grandad. My interests remain my lifelong ones of football, strongly left wing politics, literature, theatre, music and the environment. Any positive commitment I am able to make in the future (as directed by my interest) would be directed towards the environment particularly in supporting animal rights groups.
