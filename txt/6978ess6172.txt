			 I have been married for 25 years my husband is my best friend. I have three wonderful children & I am a nanny of a little girl of 4 years old from my daughter. I go to gym 1-2 a week. My job is a nursery nurse with 15 years experience, I love working with children. I try to keep healthy but because I am always on the go working full time with a family suffer know with IBS as I worry alot. If I could have my life over again I would like a normal upbringing & a mum/dad as I was put into several homes as a child that is why my family mean so much to me.
