I imagine when I am 60 years old my life may not be very different. I would imagine that my husband and I will be living in the same house and think it very likely that we will both remain in the same jobs, albeit the jobs will have altered somewhat. Hopefully we will both remain healthy and have more leisure time. Working shorter hours. My two sons will be in their late 20s and will presumably have left home. Therefore we will probably not have as many financial concerns and have more time and money to spend on holidays and leisure activities. I would like to have travelled more, both home and abroad. I would not at this stage anticipate my sons moving too far away and would hope to have plenty of contact with them. I look forward to fulfilling more personal ambitions, but mainly hope for good health for myself and my family.

I am 60 years old. My life has changed dramatically from when I was 50 years old. To begin with, my parents-in-law are no longer with us - ((maybe) they are in a home and not needing the volume of care from me that I gave them ten years ago)). My husband, {HUSBAND}, is nearing retirement and we will be able to spend all our time together, just as we did twenty years ago. I am really looking forward to that. We are still totally devoted to each other and in love after thirty-two years of marriage. Generally, I am in good health - just the on going monitoring and defibrillator box changes for my heart (following a cardiac arrest in 1990). Few aches and pains, but at my age that is expected (they actually started when I was 50!). My memory is still no better than it was as long ago as thirty years ago (this caused by me suffering total amnesia when I had the cardiac arrest). The trips down to {LOCAL} Hospital are very infrequent now - not every three months as they were ten years ago. Most of my regular check-ups are now done via the telephone line! We are thinking of moving - within the village. We are sensible enough to know that the stairs and four bedrooms will become too much for us as we age further. We may buy an apartment - even closer to the shops, pubs and restaurants, then where we are now. Or, we move to a bungalow on this estate. Will just have to see what happens. I still go to the many things that I have belonged to in the village for many years. These include yoga - important for flexibility, Ladies Luncheon Club, Probus, WI and of course the dinner evenings that some girlfriends and myself take in turns cooking a meal. We have been doing this for many years.

I have just retired as a full time nurse & have gone back to work doing two sessions a week whilst drawing my NHS pension. I enjoy my job, having less responsibility than I used to have. I am a season ticket holder at {LOCAL} Football Club & enjoy going to most of the home matches with my husband. I enjoy going on 2-3 holidays a year, still working enables me to do this. I also enjoy soending time with my children & grandchildren. This gives me the most pleasure. I have fewer migraines than I used to have when I was pre-menopausal and still working. I do still get occasional neck & back pain. I worship regularly in our local church & am still part of the music group. I also attend the church fellowship group once a week.

At 60 years old, I am living a very lonely life, with very little contact with my family. I have suffered heart disease in the past few years, and possibly facing the prospect of cancer treatment. I am unable to work or go out at all because of nerves and other phobias. I have made nothing of myself in the past and feel I have nothing to contribute for the future.

I am not 60 years old. I have recently retired from my job as a Teaching Assistant. My husband is still working and both of our children have left home. I still take regular exercise, several mornings a week. I am hopeing to re-start my Open University degree course which was put on hold due to work commitments several years ago. I have a keen interest in computing and gaving gained several qualifications now use mainly for personal interest. It keeps my mind active. I am enjoying my time at home but like to keep myself busy. I am lucky enough to take several holidays a year. These range from short breaks with either my husband or with friends, to longer breaks for a couple of weeks. My husband and I regularly have weekends away - we both enjoy these and come back feeling relaxed .. I am hoping to find a part-time job which would allow me to meet people and utilise some of my skills. This maybe on a volunteer basis, such as Citizens Advice or a paid employment opportunity. However, until then I am happy to just enjoy my time at home.

Relaxing back in the warm sunshine I am so pleased I left the gloom of England so far behind. I do not miss the grey weather, the arthritis threatening in my 50's is gone and the active lifestyle here keeps me fit, healthy & happy. Nor do I miss the anxiety caused by ever-rising fuel bills, crippling taxes & rapidly shrinking returns on my savings. Here I know I can access medical treatment if I need it and can safely walk or go anywhere without fear of violence or being mugged. My work with the environmental conservation programme is stimulating and rewarding and makes me feel valued, unlike the years spend in low paid health care in the UK and when I am finally too old to work at all I know I won't have to worry how I'll manage, as my mother did, as I have my own house within a community that cares about and respects each other; where there are amenities for all and clubs, social activities and meeting places for any age and culture, so old age is not the lonely, frightening prospect it is for many that I left behind.

Observation ID: N27560Z
My imagination is quite good but does not lead to foretelling the future. Of course we would all like to retire early, win the lottery, be happy, wise and healthy. However, this is not reality, with the pension crisis it is unlikely that employers will be retiring employee's early on pension. Therefore, it is likely that I will be working at 60. Health & well being - who knows what ailments a person will develop over 10 years. I suspect my sight disability will get worse over the next 10 years. Further interests are difficult to develop whilst working and looking after someone. I prefer not to look ahead too far. I like to take each day as it comes.

I also want to share this with my wife, we look forward to future days, a new life, and lots of new things to do. I would like to do some kind of voluntary work.

I envisage that I will be semi-retired, working either in a teaching consultancy role or some P/T supply work. I would hope that my myself and my wife will own a 2nd property, either in the United States or Southern Europe & will spend extended holiday periods there. As a diabetic my health, both through my own iniative & through careful hospital monitoring as a diabetic is good, & I forsee that this should continue to be the case in the future.

We go to the theatre, ballet, out for walks and for meals. I have met a man who becomes a close friend and possibly a long term partner. I have had concerns over my heart and make a concerted effort to change my lifestyle & lose weight. Both my parents have passed away within the last couple of years and I am feeling "raw". I still live alone and in the same house I continue to enjoy music (radio, concerts, CDs etc) I like to dress well (smart/casual) and still wear light make-up.

I would hope that in ten years time I would still be working but in a position where I could comfortably retire to enjoy some leisure time. This would be with my wife and my seventeen year old son would be thinking about going to university. I would expect to be a grandfather as my two daughters would be 38 and 31 respectively. I would expect my health to still be good and that I would be reasonably active still. I would still be researching my family tree, which I began in the 1980's and would also be following cricket with some trips to follow England on tour. I would still be employed as an educational consultant either with a local authority of self employed. Life would be as good as it is now and I would be happy.

I am happily married, semi retired enjoying life to the full, going away for long weekends and having several holidays a year. I spend some time with my family. I have my health issues under control so it does not stop me doing what I want to.

Observation ID: N22556H
Although I cannot afford to retire & live on my state pension I am really pleased to be able to continue to contribute by sharing my knowledge & passing it onto others. When I was younger I would never have imagined the developmental curve I would enter in my 40's & 50's, bringing together my creative interests ie art, music, comedy & drama with my professional work with young people. I am amazed at how my songwriting is embedded in my life & that I have the opportunity to perform & play with other musicians, travel & meet many new people . . . and spend some time with the grandchildren!

Observation ID: N27177W
I have finally retired on a very good pension, this enables my husband and myself to have several holidays a year. Both my children are settled and are happy in their working lives. I do voluntary work at the local Maternity Hospital. 1 day a week I find this quite fulfilling. My health could be better my joints are a little stiff and my blood pressure continues to be a problem. We continue to visit National Trust homes, and find it easier because we can now visit in the week when it is a little quieter.

Observation ID: N10658Z
I would hope to still be in good health. Hopefully working part-time enabling me to have a more leisurely life. I may do some voluntary work, but also see friends, have time to do some gardening, shopping and have a slower pace of life. Hopefully there will be grandchildren, I would like to spend time with them. I would have hoped to have moved to a smaller house with a smaller, more manageable garden.

Observation ID: N26666E
When 60 I would like to carry on with the things I do now (Married) Sport, Art Re-painting Landscapes etc. and be retired.

Observation ID: N15825S
At 60 I would hope to be enjoying retirement with my husband, secure in the knowledge that my children are supporting themselves adequately and my parents are also receiving any care and support they may need. It's likely however that our desire to travel, take extended ski-holidays and attend sporting events, will be tempered by the need to continue to support both parents and children. I would hope our health is good enough to enable us to take up walking again, ski and swim. Any work undertaken would be strictly as a result of financial necessity and would probably relate to educational provision/consultancy, but not class teaching. I would like to imaging myself experiencing a sense of freedom that the constraints of work have inhibited for many, many years.

Observation ID: N25473T
Still working in the music industry and in a secure position financially. Still able to do the things I want both mentally and physically.

Observation ID: N26685H
I continue to work on a part-time basis in a school. This gives me several dimensions to my life. Firstly, the social aspect of working environment, secondly the feeling of usefulness any job gives and finally, supplements the small private pension I have so that I can continue to enjoy a reasonable standard of living. As I have got older, I have found time to spend on myself, doing activities I want to do to keep me fit and active, I've lost some weight and have more energy (something that I was determined to do when I was fifty) and am enjoying life to the full. Time goes so quickly. I enjoy spending time with our grandchildren but worry about what the future holds for them. On the whole, I am content with my life. Scenario Two- we've sold up and moved to a warm country and having a great time learning a new language & culture!

Observation ID: N23384K

We will be financially comfortable - taking several holidays / short breaks abroad each year. I hope to retain my good health and to spend time walking in the countryside / hills / mountains.

Observation ID: N10693C
I would like to think I will be working part time dividing my time between paid work & voluntary work.

Now that I am 60 I have retired from my full time job as an Assistant Head Teacher although I sometimes return to class, to do some supply teaching, as I was concerned that I would miss work, especially the children & my colleagues. I think I will get used to retirement though, as already I am spending more time painting (although an art specialist I didn't have sufficient time to paint when teaching). I am noticing that I am less stressed now; I enjoyed teaching immensely but the stress levels were high. I have greater time to enjoy my home now, have taken on some home improvements & enjoying new recipes, etc. I am grateful that my health is still good so that I can enjoy life to the full, especially my role as a grandparent!

My wife and good health are very important to me, having enough money to travel and continue to do the things I enjoy such as golf and other leisure activities.

My husband is still my best friend and continues to make me laugh, although he has had some health problems which have been ongoing for several years, but he retains his sense of humour which attracted me to him! We love each other deeply and continue to plan visits and activities to share, unlike some of our friends who get on each other's nerves or under each other's feet in retirement. Both our children are happily settled in relationships, {DAUGHTER} having married and produced two beautiful grandchildren, whom we try not to spoil too much! My mum still lives on her own and looks after herself, although the issue of where she will go when this is too hard for her is being discussed openly. I still go out with 'the girls' for our monthly lunch and general catch up on news. I'm happy, grateful for my health and life is sweet!

Observation ID: N16228F
By the time I am 60, I intend to have a second home somewhere in the sun! The main thing I dislike about the U.K. is the terrible weather, also we are taxed to death !

My main interests are our Garden, cats and my much loved football team 'Birmingham City' and most of all my husband. used to travel around the world but now a days it is harder because of money and my health as I cannot sit still for more that three hours.

My two children will have settled into jobs they want, having done well at school. I will no longer be working, and will be travelling to many places in the world with my wife. Both of us will finally be able to pursue our joint interests of painting. Most importantly in that we have a wide circle of friends to enjoy our recreational time with. I suspect that my health may have deteriorated regarding joints/flexability I hope this will not impact on our hopes of walking holiday. Although not rich, with some careful budgeting we should be able to have a fairly comfortable life and do the things we want.

Observation ID: N18997Z
Now that I am 60 years old my health is better as I hav'nt smoked for the last nine years and started a fitness programme at the same time, so I regularly go swimming and do keep fit at the gym with my wife {WIFE} who has already retired. I only work part time now and have more liesure time for activities and visiting family & friends and going on holidays. The children have all left home and are all happy & healthy, and we now have grandchildren who we often have to stay, and take out with us. The mortgage and loans are now paid off, so we can help out the children financially now and then. We have moved to a small bungalow nearby to the rest of the family, and will probably start to spend a month abroad in the winter months in later years to somewhere warm if we have enough saved.

Observation ID: N21485F
At 60, I would expect my health to deteriate, restricting me even further. I would still be in fulltime employment if my health permits it as government dictates we retire at 65. I don't see 60 as being any different to me being 50 now, except being slower, and my health deteriating. There are times when I don't think I will reach 60. I will persue Interests when I retire, as I will have the time Then.

I'd hopw that we would be healthy and fit enough to fen walk and do the sports we'd like to do like cycling archery (him) and skiing. I'd like the children to be settled in careers which were fulfilling and made them financially independent and had settled stable relationships. I'd hope we all had good health and be happy and content. I would just review what I wanted to do & what others wanted or needed me to do and probably compromise.

Although I am now 60 years old, my life is not much different from my life 10 years ago. My mortgage is now paid and I have a pension from the forces which means that I do not have to work as much overtime to maintain my standard of living. I still have the same job but have slowed down a bit because my body is ageing faster that my mind. I intend to work for as long as I can because I believe that retirement will kill me of Boredom!

We walk our dog on the beach every day and regularly walk in the hills or along the coastal path. I work one day a week as a volunteer in a charity shop and I also help out at the nearby Riding for the Disabled Association. I am in excellent physical & mental health. I work hard in our garden to make it an oasis of peace & calm, assisted by my hsband who loves gardening. The only blib on the horizon is my husband's health.

If I'm not dead, then health-or lack of it- will dominate life. The arthritis in the knees can only get worse: mobility limited to crutches, wheelchair & stairlift. Driving will likely be an activity of the past - eyesight getting worse. Shopping likely to be delivered. Active interests are already giving way to knitting, crochet, sewing, spinning & weaving - these will last as long as the eyesight and nimble fingers. As to work? nobody wants to employ an old crock!

That I'm still healthy enough to be around and watch my grand children grow up. Life's to short to worry about work Maybe the new generation should be out there working and giving the old un's a chance to enjoy what life might be left for them to enjoy. But all I see is the older one's keeps working while the young one's Don't want to. And there just No Discipline Anymore. So how can younger People respect things, when its all been taken away & made easy for them.

I am still at work because of the mortgage, but enjoy it less these days - school is not really a place for 60 year olds. My children are wonderful, & I see as much of them as possible, but am careful not to be a nuisance to them. {HUSBAND} wants to sell the house and move, & I am thinking about this - I don't really want to move before I retire. The house is important to me as long as we live in this area. But in a few years time, I would like to be back beside the sea. We travel a lot, & there are thousands of places I want to see. Keeping fit & active is important to me. I have the idea of being unable to move, be independent.

At 60 I would hope I would not be working and would have more time to explore interests or oppotunities. I would anticipate that at 60 plus I maybe involved in helping care for grandchildren possibly and this would inevitable constrain my free time, but not in a the same way as working for an employer does. I would like to have free time to pursue some things such as getting to grips with a computer, learning to swim, playing the piano. My youngest child would be leaving home when I am 60 to go to university and this will require a lot of adjusting to. I feel it is impossible to predict what may happen to my health, but I feel it is inevitable that I will not be as healthy due to the ageing process

I would like to hope I'll feel much the same at 60 as I do at 50. I would obviously expect to have slowed down a little more and maybe start to have some minor health problems. As one of the first groups of women to have to work until 65 I hope I'll still be active and comptent enough to carry out my job at the same efficent level and, above all, still have a job! As my mortgage will be nearly ended maybe I could then afford to have work carried out to improve my home. I would still expect to be single but I would hope to still have family member living close by. I imagine my interest and hobbies to be much the same as now as by still having to work full time I wouldn't have any more lesiure time. I would like to hope I might have gained new skills by finally owning a computer at home!

Either that or Im going to be the mad old biddy that always sits next to 'you' on the bus & talk about 'the good old days' hope I'm the first scenario gently plodding on continuing to learn new things & all in all quite liking her life.

Observation ID: N15838X
I imagine that my health, outlook and aspirations will be as much as they are now. The main changes will reflect the fact that my children will be largely grown and leading adult lives. Career wise, my professional life will have moved me towards projects that I enjoy and interest me. Children independent, more time and more disposable income will - I hope - mean more time for my wife and I to do some of the things we have always wanted to do but 'put off' while we have been raising our family. We will have greater time and energy for each other, for romance and to be 'spontaneous'. I would also like to be more involved in doing things to help/benefit others and my community.

60 already! The children have all left home now; the third one is in her final year of university. Since the first one was born when I was 29, I've spent half my life looking after them, and now I'm looking after mum. She can't drive any more, so I've moved in with her. No point renting the flat any longer - and my husband is at last half way through building his own house, his long-held ambition. So we'll live there one day. I decided to retire at 60 instead of 65. Now I spend two days a week volunteering at the prison. It is how I want to leave a legacy, not of money, but of making a difference to people's lives.

I imagine I may have developed minor arthritic complaints. I hope to be otherwise healthy.

Observation ID: N12861J
I would still be working full time as I have to support myself. I do not envisage my health being too much different to my current state of health unless I was unlucky enough to get the cancer back again. I have a few close friends and envisage that I would still be in contact with them. I am unsure as to what my interests in 10 years time would be.

Observation ID: N20159Q

Observation ID: N15817S
I fear that at 60, I will find myself widowed and having to face life alone, coping with trying to maintain the house and having to work longer hours to support myself. The life I would like to have at 60 is similar to the life I lead now - a part-time job, several holidays away in a motorhome and occasional meal out. At 60, I shall no longer have the responsibility for my aging mother but will probably be required to babysit the grandchildren. Failing eyesight makes it even harder to keep up my main interest-playing the piano, but don't rule out the fulfillment of a dream - to have drum lessons, I expect to continue to meet up with with my school friends as I have done for the last 40 years and to enjoy their company.

I cannot predict whether my main relationship will still survive, but I expect to continue with most of my friendships and probably spend more time together.

I hope to retire in 5 years’ time when I am 56. I have 2 houses in {COUNTRY Europe} and I will retire there with my wife. I will have more time to take exercise which I struggle to do at the moment with my hectic way of life. I have had a house in {COUNTRY Europe} for 12 years and feel much more a part of that community because the people are much more friendly than those of the every changing (not for the better) Britain. I feel we as British citizens have 'lost' the country and there is little else to do than move where the values of people are as they were 30 years ago in our country.

I am working full time to make ends meet - paying for teenager & one child at university. I'm struggling with a dodgy hip and have my name down for a hip replacement. I live with my husband but not often amicably. I'm looking forward to retirement and the children being more independent. I see more of my friends and am now able to follow my personal interest now that the children are older, though I worry about them - whether they've taking drugs etc. or have good friends. We have little spare cash and holiday with relatives. We use public transport whenever possible and recycle / minimse electrical use and petrol too. It's too late to do anything about getting a decent pension so we plan to rent out a room to make ends meet. Entertainment is T.V. or D.V.D. I drink less (and less) alcohol and we never eat out as it's too expensive. We grow vegetables where our lawn used to be. Life is quiter though possibly more personally rewarding.

Observation ID: N19542A
My planned retirement at 55 did not happen. My 'guranteed' pension based on last annual salary was greatly reduced by the Labour government, to a level insufficient to support me. I am now faced with another 15 years hard graft to reach 75 and national old age pension. I should not complain. I'm fortunate to have a job now that I'm a convicted criminal (unlawfully exceeding the weekly limit for refuse placed in a local authority recepticle) and Macdonalds are not unreasonable employers. And no matter how bad the economy, the populace will always want junk food. After a 12 hour shift, what better than a spot of fishing. If I economise for the next week or two, I'll soon be able to afford a tub of maggots for bait.!.

Observation ID: N22144R

As part of this survey, I remember completing a section like this in the late 1960s (early 1970s about what I expected my life to be like when I was 25. It must have been when I was about 11. It is therefore interesting nearly 40 years on to be asked the same sort of questions. I very much hope that I will continue to enjoy good health when I am 60 and that my family and friends will still do so although I am realistic enough to realise that my elderly parents (now 80) will probably be dead. I hope my children now 12 and 19 will have successfully completed their UNCLEAR education and will have fulfilling jobs and perhaps settled and happy long term relationships. I hope my husband will retire but find something interesting to do. As for me, I hope to have completed another degree, have time for my friends and family and enjoy my dog even if it is another one!

I have achieved my ambition of being an advocate. I have been able to utilise all the educational and life experiences I have had, to held others less fortunate, articulate and confidant as myself. This I find very rewarding. As I have gone from single parent, struggling to making ends meet to being comfortable. My leisure pursuits include; visiting castles and places of Interest. Reading both acedemic and fictional works. Being able to relax with a nice glass of wine. Travelling to any any places that take my Fancy, having lovely wlakds in the country and being surrounded by my son and daughter's families consisting of lovely well adjusted children. My health is not too bad as I am able to look after myself properly.

In ten years time I envisage that I will still be fit, running, walking, swimming, yoga lessons and canoeing! I hope to be doing some creative writing and have time for my grandchildren (Should I have any). My son will be 21 and maybe finishing University and hopefully still very involved with us at home. I will still have a love of music, reading and radio and my gardening skills will have greatly improved. I will have regular lunch dates with old friends and my husband and I will have lots of short holiday breaks. I may be considering another dog (less lively than my now young springer spaniel). I could go on....but sitting here thinking about 10 years on I feel very optimistic - Part time work of course of it is still possible.

I expect that my home life will be similar to today - I like stability. My health is impossible to predict, but there is no reason to think that it will be a problem. My work is likely to be similar to today, though perhaps with a further increase in managerial responsibilities and decrease in keeping on top of the scientific research.

At 60 my disability has worsened although the new medications have left the functions I can still do for myself less painful. The local Authority are still no nearer to providing suitable housing. Hobbies are fne but they cost money, exept the free pastimes of say Walking, picnics but mobility is and has been painful and I am sure always will be now. {PARTNER} my partner is a star and has stood by me 40 years now! Plus the kids still visit regular than most kids would given they are 37 and 28 and have their own lives so we are lucky - just not able to enjoy the stuff normal, able people take for granted, and there's precious little to do here for them. So we do what we can after rain you can only expect fair weather so hope is still the order of the day + 60 and still here. Its hard - preferable to the alternative! and who knows - they may start to listen! too.

Interests: I only learnt to read for pleasure in my 50's so I read a lot. In addition I enjoy gardening, walking, visiting places of interest & beauty (my partner and I have been members of National Trust for many years) and observing wildlife - particularly birds. I attend Church now which is something I didn't do when I was younger. I have a close knit group of female friends and I meet with them monthly. I am always have something on the go for myself such as an evening class or making something … Home Life: I am still with my partner. We are still living in the same area. I am worried about money, my pension and I'm looking for ways to economise. My partner and I don't have any children and we spend a lot of time together. My parents are still alive but they are ailing and they are a constant concern for me. By brother and sister are able to give my parents good practical and financial care whereas I seem to have more time and give emotional care. My siblings & their families live fairly close and I spend time with them; we get along better now that we have ever done. Health & Well Being: I feel well emotionally, socially and intellectually but not necessarily physically. I do yoga and walk as often as I can, mainly in the summer, but I know that my health is deteriorating; I am still overweight and not as fit as I should be, I am aware of the impact this has on my health and I expect it to get worse particularly affecting my back and knees. I am worried about my health but I am complacent. Work: I am working as Counsellor and enjoying it very much; I retrained when I was 50 and it still feels new and challenging; this time I have the confidence of life experience and maturity; I am still enjoying studying and continuing to invest in my 'second' career. I work part time as an employee and privately; I am comfortable in my work; I fee competent, self confident and able to assert myself.

I will still enjoy travelling but still not have found what I want out of life! My health will have deteriorated, hair loss, teeth & skin will have aged. I will yearn for my youth and wish I had done some things that I had always wanted to do. I will dread the possibility of ending my days in a nursing home due to an illness like dementia or Alzheimers, as I'm sure many people of my age already do

Observation ID: N28270W
By 60yrs old I hope I am in a stable strong relationship. It would not matter if I was married again. I hope my 2 children are settled either in this country or here in Great Britain. They would have a job they love & relationships that make them content & happy. I hope I can still be active with my sports & enjoy a variety of new sports. My health will be fine, my back pain sorted. My job I hope will be varied and I hope to have moved sideways into a field I can expand on. I hope to be part of a community again wherever I have settled. Mostly, however, I want to be at a good place where I can look back with fondness & move forward with a feeling of content.

I imagine that I will be owning & running a bed & breakfast in the south of England (going back to my home area after living away for 10 years). Still working as a way to earn money for mortgage and living.

I play darts once a week and do voluntary work with credit union and go to church once a week. I enjoy my life as it is and can't envisage any great changes. The biggest change will be that my husband will be retired by then, hopefully we'll be able to enjoy his retirement together.

It is very difficult to imagine 10 years into the future as you can't ever know what could be around the corner. My home life would be different as probably my two sons wouldnt be living with my husband and myself and maybe grandchildren would change things. Hopefully my health would continue to be good and therefore work could still be almost as it is now. The main thing is my husband and myself would have more time to spend together as he would be retired my then.

At 60, I would want to be leading the same life as I am now, though with my husband retired and spending time at our house in Spain and keeping house here in the UK, dividing our time between the two. I hope to be healthy, comfortably off financially and able to help our daughter purchase a house. Work wise, it would probably be voluntary as I would not want to be tied to a job. The only thing I would like to do is have a holiday cottage to let, which can be summer let or 6-monthly, which would not be too much of a tie.

In 10 years time I would expect my parents to have died. My children will be in their twenties and should have completed university and be self supporting. I would expect my husband to have retired from mainstream work. My husband and I are currently in good health and there is no reason to believe that there should be any significant deterioration on the next 10 years. So, aged 60, I should have time to spend with my husband, travelling, enjoying outdoor pursuits such as hiking and skiing, and visiting theatres and attending concerts. I might also take up some new academic study.

This is difficult - as it is impossible to project with any accuracy what my life will be like in 10 years time. I would like to think that I will still be working in some capacity, to preserve my emotional well-being & financial health. My {SON} will have left home and I will sorely miss his company, and I hope that I will still have my friends around me - friendship means a lot. Financial security remains an issue - I have few savings so without work life will be very different - and this will impact upon my leisure pursuits - theatre, cinema, travelling. I exercise a lot & my health is good, but I of course expect deterioration of some kind - my back is already a problem rather like my mother, who suffers a great deal. Nonetheless, I am reasonably optimistic about the future and aways open to new opportunities with regards to work & lifestyle choices.

I still hope to be enjoying my current hobbies, computing, listening to music taking photographs and dabbling with small electronic circuits. At home we would be getting used to living without children/ young adults around us. I would like to think life would be more green with self sufficiency in terms of food and energy being great parts of our lives. I would be disappointed not to be able to cycle on at least 3-4 occasions a week. With the expected increase in free time, it would be good to explore more of the english countryside - more and longer walks in the fresh air. Some form of work, part time, would be required to help supplement an early withdrawl from full time employment. Part time consultancy or tuition work of some 2-3 days a week particularly in the winter months. I look forward to be able to enjoy more time with my wife and family as the working week shrinks. I would expect to have sufficient funds to be able to maintain the current lifestyle I enjoy. All in all it sounds a fun age to be!

I hope to have retired from teaching but will need to do something to occupy my time - hopefully I'll be able to devote more time to my hobbies of cake decorating & flower arranging. My husband & I hope to spend quite a lot of time travelling, sometimes with our friends. We will also spend time with our three children & by then, a few grandchildren I expect! I hope my husband's health will have improved (or at least not got worse) & that the joint pains I'm experiencing are only symtematice of the menopause & not arthritis. I expect to still be living in this area, probably in the house. We'll have a good private income from investments - we hope!

Observation ID: N23226W
I AM NOW 60 YEARS OLD I AM STILL VERY ACTIVE AND HEALTHY. MY CHILDREN ARE HAPPY STABLE AND LIFE IS GOOD AND FULFILLING FOR THEM. I SPEND MY RETIRED DAY'S WALKING, GOING TO THE GYM AND OCCASSIONALLY DOING SOME NURSING DUTIES TO CONTINUE TO CARE FOR PEOPLE. I SPEND MY DAYS FEELING CONTENT AND HAVING A HAPPY AND SUPPORTIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH MY PARTNER. BUT IS THIS WISHFUL THINKING ??? IM EVER THE OPTOMIST !

Observation ID: N16358Q
At sixty I still expect to be married and still working although I may be working less hours. I hope I will be healthier than at present as I will have more time for activities. I may be a grandparent but hope not as I hope my children (who will be 26 and 24) then will have children when older. I hope my children will have left home but think it more likely that at least one may still be living with us!

Observation ID: N19150N
Enjoying the Grandchildren, garden and looking after my chickens. Just generally taking live easy and taking each day as it comes.

Observation ID: N20477B
Hopefully retired from my job and still in good health. Probably walk more and do more gardening and DIY. Visit relations and possibly look after my grandchildren some days. Take advantage of cheap holiday breaks and travel regularly. Move to another house with flat garden in a quiet area. Take up knitting again and bake more. May need to care for my mother in law who would be 83. My youngest child would be 32 so my husband & I would be able to suit ourselves what we do.

Observation ID: N21717C
At 60 I hope I will be close to retirement and able to spend far more time at home with my husband and family - with maybe a future grandchild to help support. This should help keep us on an even keel!!

I find it very difficult to look ten years ahead. I have taught myself to try to deal with things day to day as the result of my difficulties recently. I would hope that in ten years time I will enjoy generally good health. Perhaps be a grandmother and have written a book and have a home of my own again and be financially Stable. Maybe I will be lucky enough to find a new partner to share things with - to cook for and to love.

Observation ID: N25195Q
I shall be retired and looking forward to enjoying holidays outside school holidays (I am a teacher). I plan to travel in England and abroad. I expect to enjoy my house which I have been decorating for 15 years and expect to finish by then. I expect my friends to be around and I will enjoy more time with them. I would be tempted to take part time employment but do not look towards something that would tie me down. I have the opportunity of a good pension and have paid AVC's to enhance this. Consequently I expect to be living within my means. I could always downsize the house if financial problems raise their heads.

Observation ID: N11113Z
I enjoy the comforts of my home and spending a little leisure time with my husband. I wish my health was better than it is and I could get around easier. I enjoy the travelling across Europe we do.

Observation ID: N14965Z
I would hope that by the age of 60 I would have given up full time employment and found my ideal 'job' by making a living from "Personal investing" giving me the freedom to enjoy "quality time" with my wife and step-family. Alternatively, I would hope to be involved in running my/our own (family) business. I would also like to have the time to be involved in local/community affairs, possibly as a local councillor. This would increase my psychological well being and the rewards of "lifes luxuries" would give me satisfaction and add further meaning to my life. I would hope that my health holds steady as I will probably be caring for my wife.

Observation ID: N28368F
I would like to think that very little could have changed. I would still be able to participate in the local community, and carry out voluntary work with the younger members of the village. It would be nice to feel comforted by the way my children have progressed into adult life and they are safe and well. And that the loving relationship I have with my wife is still as strong as the day we met. Keeping fit ans persuing hobbies, but most of all, being able to come and care for the people that mean the world to me.

I think by then that I will probably have given up running due to ageing and joint problems from running to many marathons and 1/2 marathons. Hopefully my fitness will keep me in reasonable health and I will probably have taken up cycling by then as a replacement activity for running.

At sixty years old I am still working part-time and mostly enjoy my job. I am thinking of retirement and may decide to retire earlier than 65 years if my investments allow. I often see my grandchildren who like to come and stay. Two years ago when my daughter left home I moved into a smaller cottage in the country and the equity from my home will hopefully allow me to retire comfortably. I holiday on average 3 times a year, usually to Italy. I am still with my partner and very happy. Arthritis has taken its toll on my knee, however it has not yet stopped my yearly skiing holiday - I am just more cautious. Life is good.

I hope and expect to use my financial position and spare time to travel and explore more with my partner. I hope to be in a steady long-term relationship, which looks likely.

Observation ID: N22147U
I have to decide if I want to retire from my job or keep working. This will be based on the type of work I am doing at the time, where I am in terms of completing the work and if I am still enjoying what I do & the people I work with. Assuming I'm in good health, I shall probably look to retire, or at least cut down full time work so I can make the most of my personal life. I shall probably take some time out to decide what I want to do with my personal life & what my partner wants to do. I shall then devote my time to pleasing myself! Well for at least as long as I can!

I have been "retired" for 3 1/2 years, however, I have still worked one to two days a week in a concultancy basis. The extra income has topped up my pension and has allowed my wife and I to lead a good life. We holiday four or five times a year and try to attend three or four major sporting/musical events each year. This year we are looking forward to the World Cup finals. Our health is good and indeed since retiring I walk a lot more, spend more time considering a healthy diet and have lost half a stone in weight.

At last I've retired from graft and the lottery win means I can run the bookshop and still have time to really make a difference in the garden.

Crime is zero since the introduction of 'Execution' but only on the first offence and everyone seems to be smiling.

I probably wont be teaching then as I find the job more & more stressful as it is & I only work 2 days a week (jobshare). If I have enough money I would like to work voluntarily helping in charity shops at the hospital or maybe even driving a mini bus for the elderly & disabled. {DAUGHTER} my youngest child will probably be at university & maybe the boys will have left home by then too. I shall imagine my health will be similar to what it is now, although it may improve once I have gone through the menopause. My interests will probably be the same ie. going to the gym, cooking, reading etc but the only difference being that I may have more time to do them!

Now I am 60, I have just started my retirement I think that we have been lucky (and sensible) to have enough pension and savings to enjoy a comfortable - though not extravagant - retirement. We are looking forward to being able to travel more widely. My husband, who also retired recently, is also in good health. Our children are now 32 and 30 years old and are enjoying fulfilling careers. As they do not live with us, we enjoy visiting them regularly. We usually enjoy good health and, although my athritis occasionally flares up, we can still take part in our favourite activities like walking and gardening. We both enjoyed our careers in teaching and feel that we did make a difference. That is a good feeling to have.

My partner and I moved to our present address in 2005 to lead a more relaxed, stress free lifestyle in the countryside. We plan (health permitting) to live here for the next 15-20 years, by which time the size of the property may become to much to maintain, prompting us to downsize. I'm hoping at 60 to draw on a past company pension, enabling me to reduce my working week so giving me more time so spend with my Partner. Enjoying walks in the surrounding countryside & mountains, Gardening (we grow most of our own Vegetables for the year) The occasional exotic holiday, and for myself, fishing & D.I.Y. I enjoy the line of work I'm in at the moment and can see myself with the same company in ten years time. My partner ensures we eat fresh, healthy homecooked food everyday, we walk ten miles plus every week with the dog, hardly drink & don't smoke. Adding this all up we hope to be in good health in ten years time and beyond.

I took early retirement at 55yrs and am now involved in other aspects of working, ie. more involved with my husbands' company and doing some voluntary work. We have grandchildren, so I enjoy spending time with them. We have bought our own property abroad, so I spend several months a year in the sunshine. This keeps me in fairly good health. Although the above is my ideal life at 60, I know that circumstances and events can change things drastically. Whatever happens, I do feel confident that I can adapt and cope with whatever the future holds.

Observation ID: N20479D
Due to my health I don't think I shall be working, but would hope to be free of pain. I would like to think I would have grandchildren and would like to go traveling and work in the garden.

I am now retired and enjoying living in my own home. I am still happily married.

Observation ID: N16352J

Having moved back to the North West after living in London for 25 years, the pace of life seemed much slower, but I am enjoying living in a village in more of a community. I am managing to spend more time on my hobbies, golf, gardening, walking and voluntary work. I am also enjoying my part time job and at present my health is ok.

Observation ID: N26965N
At 60 I plan to retire. I see my life being fulfilled by enjoying Leisure pursuits, my family may have increased with grandchildren who I may help to support. My health may deteriorate but nobody knows this, I will make the best of it anyway - remaining active to the best of my ability. I would like to travel further. I may still have parents who I will feel responsible for - this may affect my quality of life - I don't know.

Observation ID: N10852Z
Working at B&Q because no one will employ a 60 year old in an engineering job. Having to work because my pension company has collapsed, and I have re-mortgage the house to live. I do DIY to keep the costs down around my home. Occasionally see my children. Still living with my wife who has similar problems. We may have emigrated.

Hopefully my health will be better and my interests will have taken off again. Less hours at work would be a big benefit with a more social life becoming evident.

Observation ID: N28453B
I would hope to be active and healthy - hopefully not working full time (maybe part time). I would like to be more involved with the activities of my church & perhaps other voluntary work. I would probably still be single & living on my own though I am certainly open to other possibilities. I would hope to have a good circle of friends still & continue to enjoy the company of my sisters & in-laws. I would like to write, to visit the country often & spend a lot more time working on my allotment.

Observation ID: N11141D
At 60 I hope to be doing interesting work on a project, 'as & when' basis, but also to be spending more time holidaying, both in this country & abroad incl. some long haul travel. Currently I am getting over a whiplash injury, but at 60 I would hope not to have any after effects, & to be in v. good health - mind and body. I hope to be still walking, swimming & cycling regularly. I'd like to be doing more voluntary work as a way of 'putting something back' into the community. I see my homelife continuing to be settled, but by 60 just {HUSBAND} & me at home with our daughters independent, I want to maintain excellent & loving relationships with both of them, and I think I will. The type of work I do is mostly H.R. - I see myself continuing to work in people development.

Observation ID: N14344A
Still living in the same area - Maybe becoming a grandparent but not essential. In a different role within the same job - more responsibility. Travelling more - concerns about parents and inlaws health and well being. Health wise - in good health making more of a effort with exercise.

Observation ID: N25180H
I am still in the same job doing the same thing I always have and looking forward to retirement. Due to deteriorating health and back problems, I am unable to persue many interests, or hobbies, and spend most of my time in front of the tv. Family life is much the same as always, with me and the wife living together but not much to say to each other, and the kids still, coming round only when they want to borrow something and the grandkids much the same. The economy is still struggling, with pensions being hit, and pensioners, after working all their life, being dumped on the scrap heap, with a low standard of living. It would be nice to retire and go to live abroad where older people are respected, and where the law still has control, and prison still worries people!

I hope to enjoy holidays and days out, as now.

Be glad if my children are happy and "settled".

Now that I am 60 and having suffered from Parkinson's for about 20 years I sometimes feel very cheated from not having been able to achieve as much as I would have liked. I have a wonderful wife and 2 great boys which mean more to me than anything else. Money is a problem as I have not worked for 15 years, so no holidays, changing cars, no smoking, the occasional Bottle of wine and the odd night out for a meal. I pass the time in the Garage at my house doing small repair work, although the mind is willing I have little control over my limbs.

I hope to still be able to travel and see places I have always wanted to go. I hope to still play just as pivotal a role in my Childrens lives and grandchildrens lives as I do now. I would like to think that I am able to do some type of voluntary work as health permits. My home and family are still the most important thing in the world to me, as are my friends both old and new, I still read avidly about a wide range of topics and will always continue to be interested in current affairs and world issues. I hope life is still as exciting, interesting and full of opportunities.

I imagine that I will be active, hopefully taking more exercize than at present. I would like to have completed a doctorate and set up in private practice. I expect to have a few grandchildren by the age of 60 but sadly expect the few remaining elderly relatives to have passed on as their health is not good. I would like to have more time for creative activitities such as painting and writing and hope to continue to have many lively family gatherings. My hopes are that the children will all be happy and not needing any more financial support (!!?) I hope too to continue to be intouch with my friends and to make some new ones. As you can see I'm optimistic about the future but I've been very lucky throughout my life. I'm probably too contented and relaxed and it might help to be more 'driven'. I tend to cope with things quite well and the greatest fear might be loss of sight and independance. I'm hoping this will be a long way off at 60 however.

Observation ID: N15139B
I hope I will be still in good health and looking forward to retirement. My husband will also be retiring shortly after me so I hope we will be able to travel and spend more time together after so many years of raising a family.

I hope I will have some grand children and will be able to visit my children & grandchildren often. I would like to be involved in some environmental projects to preseve habitats and socialise with friends.

Observation ID: N24480N

I expect to be retired - although I enjoy my job so may reduce my working hours or take piecemeal work after retirement as and when required. I expect my health to have deteriorated unless I start losing weight right now and I do worry about this having turned 50. I hope my husband will still be well although I am concerned about his alcohol intake. I like our life now and I hope we are still able to enjoy our lives together. I hope I return to piano lessons and can sit and play a piece of music. Hopefully I will be more active too as I don't want to miss out on being with my great nephews and my (step) grandchild now on the way. I hope my tolerance with problems will endure as I've noticed as I get older I get annoyed more easily although some would say I've got too much tolerance! I enjoy my life and planning and looking forward. I have a lot to be grateful for.

In Nov 2006 I was dismissed for Gross Misconduct I worked for local Government for 32 years. I felt I was treated unfairly as they know I was having problems. I am now on incapacity & find it hard financially I want to work but as a result of not drinking & being sacked for an illness I have lost a lot of confidence people are usually sacked for sexual or fraudulent offences I feel ashamed to go into my town where I work. I cant go alone. This limits my capacity to do what I want also the UNCLEAR of my car. I have been sober for 12 months and see a phychiatrist have clynical depression & more than moderate mood swings, in Nov 05 my answers would have been much different or even 8 weeks ago. as four weeks I had a particularly depressive state physically I am well mentally I can't even recognise my own behaviour. - 60 years old I hope to have retrained as a foot health practitioner & work for my self as soon as I am able I will go to a gym.

I am still exercising, walking the dog, reading, cooking and keeping very active. Fingers Crossed!

When I was in my 20's I set up my pension to draw at 50. Needless to say when I reached 50 I felt it far too early to retire. I expect to feel just as fit and healthy at 60 but would like to retire and hopefully be in a position to help my children pay off their student loans & then perhaps go travelling with my husband. With more free time I would like to persue new hobbies and interests.

When I am 60 I very much hope to have moved house /area and substantially reduced my work hours. My house sale fell through recently (along with 1000's of others) and that was my opportunity to down size and leave my current employment. Hopefully, I will have managed this within the next ten years. Neither of my boys have a stable / long term relationship the 'go' but by the time I'm 60, I hope to be a 'yummy' grandma. It would be nice to have a male partner and I would not be adverse to marriage again - who knows! so quite a few welcome changes ahead!

Difficult Question!! I would not expect a great many changes in my life regarding home life and interests. My home life is settled and happy and routine and interests revolve around my Bible Based beliefs. It is my way of life. I share Bible truths regularly with others in my neighbourhood both in the English areas and in Multi Language areas, ie Polish, Asian etc. I would expect my health to be the biggest difference in my health incurring more joint pain due to fibromyalgia.

We keep our lives simple, and avoid debt so no unnecessary money worries other than normal ones such as the high cost of living and fuel bills etc.

Perhaps by then I will have some free time to devote to personal interests, eg writing, languages, and hopefully more free time to share activities with my wife. I hope to be in reasonable shape physically, and to have given up smoking.

I also do a small amount of voluntary work as and when needed. My circle of friends has increased now that I have the time for them and I see more of my family. Most of the changes in my life are due to the responsibilities/pressure/strees and commitment of my working life being left behind me.

Imagine: My life is much as it is now, working as a bookseller, partly at home and half the week away. I stay with my girlfriend in London every other week, an arrangement which has lasted. The photography I pursue outside work remains largely a self fulfilling pursuit. My mother in 2018 is 92 and is either just about ready to throw in the towel, or has just died. With her marbles and quite suddenly. My own health has been compromised by a weakened back. Not as fit as I should be, but I remain vital. Imagine: I have lost my job in the slump and, due to deteriorated health, have only managed to scuzz around in the black economy since. I am living in unpleasant circumstances. My girlfriends also ran out of work & returned to Japan. My mother has lost her marbles and all the residual family money has been sucked into cruel & exhorbitant 'care'. my photography is no longer possible. Imagine: I have won The lottery and now work full time at my photographay. I have somehow managed to fall in love & married. My mother, having decided in 2008 that she would last another 10 years, has changed her mind & wants to go on. With bags of money, this is not a problem to facilitate. My back has fully recovered & I live an active life, on & off water skis, up and down escalators.

Ive never really thought that far ahead in time but there are still a few things Id like to do in life. Like to go swimming with real wild dolphins one day and also to visit my UNCLEAR country Finland for a holiday. Or even go and live there as I feel Id really fit in living in Finland as for my health I had a check up at my Doctors a few weeks ago and was given a full bill of health so I am fine right now in time and hope to stay that way in the future. My interest at this time is music and I like watching football games on the tele. As for work right now Im looking for a job at this moment but the future does not look good there right now or for anyone else right now. But that is not a real problem that I would worry about at all as there is more to life than work and money like happiness which as always been more important to me anyway. So as long as Im happy thats all I need and right now worrying about things that you can do nothing about is there thats my motto anyway and as always been and its kept me going this far.

I may be retired, or certainly thinking about it. If I'm still working, I'd envisage being in the same sort of office job that I currently have.

I imagine my health would be good still, I'd hopeully still be with my partner & have elderly parents that I would see frequently (+ other family members) I would spend a fair amount of the time gardening & walking in the countryside, going to the theatre, seeing bands, going out for meals & visiting country houses / gardens (National Trust etc).

When I was young I often wondered what it would be like when I got old, Here I am now 60, doesn't feel much different from 50. Yes the back hurts a little more & I am not as fit as I was but I am doing just fine. The church cafe is running great who would have thought it would be such a success when we opened 10 years ago. It's great meeting people & helping them cope with life issues. Gives one satisfaction knowing that others can benefit from hearing your life experiences & how you coped & got through the difficult times. It's just great to help. Home is great especially being married to an incredible woman who cares and gives so much, she's one of a kind just amazing. Could never have coped without her. Fishing is still great, but seems to be colder at nights perhaps it's just me getting old.

I am now 60 and have been retired from work - it feels like being in heaven!! The torment and punishing burden that I have suffered for over 30 years has melted away and my days are divided between my cottage in England and my chateau in the South of France overlooking the sea where I am able to relax - swimming in the pool, reading and listening to music. Evenings are spent with our friends and neighbours - Mick Jagger is a frequent visitor - and days are spent on the beach. My health is good and neither my partner nor I envisage working ever again!!! My face lift has been a complete success and I am indistinguishable from the 30 year olds.

My life will be very different because my family will have left home so I imagine having more time and money. I will need to have a new challenge so that my husband and I can fill the gap. We are already thinking about possibly doing more sailing, walking etc. We will eat out more, entertain more like we did before the children. I may be looking after my father more. I will visit {COUNTRY America} (where my husband comes from) more and possibly have a vacation home there. I may still be working it will depend on the economy, pensions and how challenging my job is by then.

Don't think I look too bad for an old bird, but maybe the face-lift at 55 has helped ! I haven't worked since I was 45, yet I've never been bored. I've always had the capacity to fill my time & amuse myself even as a child - still trying to master Spanish (despite living a lot of our time in Spain) doing Pilates (helps the back pain) gardening, keeping house & generally helping out those who need me most. {HUSBAND} & I have now been married 38 years & its good to be sharing interests now that he's retired. We've finally achieved our dream of having a small place in Spain which we share with the family. I've never regretted not having children, but love seeing my neices & nephew & their children. I miss my parents terribly, but feel sure we'll meet up again one day. Roll on the next ten years!

As a single person I find it difficult to perceive what life would be like at 60 yrs old. I would imagine that I would still have a very happy home-life and would love to be a grandma at that age. I would like to be doing some kind of work that benefits people or working with children. My interest would probably be walking, reading etc. As regards my health I find that as I suffer from arthritis in my neck and back I find it difficult to imagine what I would be like at 60, otherwise I hope I would be generally quite healthy.

I hope that I have now met a partner and share some of his interest, thereby broading my own interests and outlook. If my sister and family are still in Western Canada, I will still be visiting regularly along with visiting other parts of North America

I'm still living on my own as I have had since 1987. I've had sporadic bouts of employment over the past 10 years, but nothing rewarding, just to bring in a few pounds instead of dipping into my savings. At 60 I'm receiving a small pension from the Royal Navy, together with a modest pension from {WORKPLACE}, allows me to live comfortably within my means. Arthritis, which plagued me in my late 40's early 50's plays a significant part in what activities I can pursue. A hip replacemtn in my early 50's has curtailed my interest in hiking. I continue to visit {PLACE1 South East England} and London annually. I'm in good shape despite Arthritis, because I have a healthy diet. I still enjoy a few beers on a Saturday night, although there are fewer pubs to chose from these days. Still hope to meet Miss Right, but fear that time has run out.

I'm active in the writing community and attend conferences and meetings more often. We have moved away from London to a house in the countryside - near {PLACE South West England}. We have some land and I've cultivated part of it for herbs and fruit trees; there is a wildflower meadow and a small wood. I spend time sitting outside writing or reading. I'm healthier than I was aged 50. My stress level has reduced, I'm eating regularly and more healthily. I'm getting more exercise with gardening and country walks. I'm comfortably off financially - we both have our pensions plus the money from inheritances and our new work - my writing and my husbands craft business. We host educational/social breaks for creative writers and enthusiasts. Our social lives have improved and more time to spend on people, and on each other. Our marriage is stronger and we are both happier and more relaxed than ten years ago when life was stressed and we were coping with jobs and family and health issus.

I haven't done as much as I would have liked to by 60yrs of age, but life has been good and I've no regrets. My husband and I have been together almost 35 years and he means more to me now than ever

Observation ID: N20418Q
GOODNESS What a Question! Well? I work in a Nursing Home though I never planned this career. I think I've always wanted to do a job to the best of my ability, and when I feel I've reached that level thought: what more could I do to make a bigger difference? I feel a great sense of how much I've learned and how far I've come. This I feel applies to my home life, and health and well being (though I did plan a homelife etc.) Its hard to imagine I'm 60, though I feel it!

Observation ID: N19754L
I am counting the years, five to be precise, until I can finally retire. I feel burnt out, exhausted and very concerned about whether I can keep up with such a demanding career. The pressure is immense to maintain the pace and enthusiasm which ten years ago was a struggle; now is overwhelming and my mind is not as quick and cannot respond to day-to-day challenges as it did when I was 50, Dismissal? Maybe.. My career has consumed my personal life; a very poor work-life balance has ensured too little time to relax and enjoy the birth of my first grandchild. I feel I have let my daughter down and also have been denied the pleasures of caring for this baby due to imposed requirement for me to remain working. My daughter has to return to work and leave our flesh and blood with a stranger as I cannot afford an early retirement. I feel bitter. I feel angry that I will be 73 years old, if I can make it til then, before my husband retires when we may finally enjoy some quality and precious time as man and wife, and as good parents to our one and only daughter.

My wife {WIFE} and I have celebrated 24 years of marriage together and we have moved home to be nearer our seconday schooling requirements for our son {SON} who is now 14 years of age and attending PERSONAL as a dayboy.

I've now given up squash which I played on a weekly basis & tennis and play a round of golf once a week. I fancy trying a language or history open university qualification and once {SON} is at college to carrying this through. Generally my health is reasonable and I've managed to reduce my weight from what it was at 50 to 14 stones now. I attend many sporting events and take him to see {TEAM1} and {TEAM2} when we are able.

I hope by 60 I will have established a training/consultancy business and that I will be working less hours for more money. This would give me time to do the things I want to do such as writing, gardening and traveling. I would hope to have a more spacious house with a larger garden. I would like to have space for my grandchildren and friends to stay. I would like to be enjoying a happy and loving life with my husband. I would see us both having a bit more time to do things that we enjoy. I hope my health will have imporoved due to stopping smoking - and drinking less - this will come as a result of less stress in my life. I hope I will have more time to enjoy walking or fitness class. I will not drive as much, work as much and will be off HRT! I would like to see myself as a calmer person at 60 but who knows what life will bring? My (6) grandchildren will be teenagers then and I would like to be able to support them emotionally and a little financialy if possible. I have one son who has Aspergers Syndrome and I hope to be around to continue supporting him in his life as well as having good times with him, holidays & outings. I imagine myself then as a mature, professional business woman, in a supportive and loving partnership with my husband. We take good care of ourselves and our children (7 between us) and our grandchildren. As we work in social work caring for other will always be part of our lives. This will have been a long journey from the proverty of my early life.

Observation ID: N12000V
At 60 I still expect to be working (teaching) (although not for many years more!) The thought of retirement will be double-edged. Less work related stress, more time to be with my wife, doing bits and pieces around the house and enjoying leisure pusuits but probably feeling less fit and healthy to enjoy them and of course the closer you get to retirement the closer you are getting to old age and death! I expect both of our daughters will have left home but I would hope that we would still be seeing them on a regular basis. I hope we will continue to enjoy a reasonable standard of living. Over the past 5 years or so we have not had to worry particularly about money, there always being sufficient income to cover outgoings, emergencies etc. and I would hope/expect this to continue. We may have got rid of the two cars my wife and I have to run for work reasons and have opted for sporty, fun vehicle (but one which is high enough off the ground so that we can get into it with aching backs and dodgy knees!). On retirement I would hope to be able to spend more time on some leisure pursuits I have: bowling with my wife and watersports (kayaking & windsurfing) On retirement I cannot imagine myself doing any regular other work.

My 2 children are now 25 and 21 and have left home, although the youngest is still at university so he may be returning home for a while soon. I am fit and healthy and still enjoy walking, cycling, gardening and meeting up with friends. I hope to be able to spend more time enjoying these and other activities as well as doing some voluntary work locally. We have just bought a small camper van and plan to spend a bit of time exploring Britain and Europe, although this may be difficult at present with several frail elderly relatives nearby requiring assistance.

I would imagine I should still be in reasonable health & enjoying a fulfilling full time job. I would expect to be more prosperous & be thinking of winding down a bit - maybe - but I am a workaholic so maybe not! I would imagine my priorities would change & holidays would be a main interest as well as gardening. I would like to think that my husband & I would be looking forward to nearing 40 years of happy marriage. I would also predict that we would still be living in the same property.

I can now enjoy freedom from an unfulfilling job And have enough money to enjoy my hobbies and take time to "smell the roses".

I do not currently have a partner - would like to think that I will meet someone - but if not I will probably be living alone.

I like to travel and live in different places. I hope I'm not doing the same job at 60, I expect to be working though. I hope my health will still be good, I will take care of myself and keep relatively fit. A lot of what I would like to do will depend on financial circumstances.

Home life - smaller house, easier to maintain by the sea. Calmer and quieter as all the children (5) will have left home. Will feel a little empty though hopefully the children will visit with grandchildren. Health - in some ways better health as moer time to look after myself, not so stressed out trying to fit so much in. Physically - probably more aches, pains and stiff joints. Work - not in paid employment though may do some other work (tutoring). I will be doing some kind of voluntary work as I cannot see a need and not do something about it. Wellbeing - able to spend time on hobbies. I will be less stressed as it has been hard bringing up 5 children. Will feel sad also -'empty nest' syndrome.

Observation ID: N19860M
At 60 I hope to still enjoy my gardening, perhaps only for my pleasure, rather than as paid employment. I am active, able to enjoy keeping fit, being outside, walking dogs, spending time in the good weather. Hopefully I can still enjoy visiting France and will keep my love of the language. I want to be fit, clear of the menopause, not overweight. It would be good to be clear of the depression that has tainted my life for the last 10 years. I will still be growing in confidence as I know I still have much to learn. I still live in the village and hope to be not a "newcomer" by then. My husband will still have his wonderful mind but will probably have slowed down a little. My love of being with him still grows. My son has a fulfilling job in London and is still happy with his partner. I hope he is able to enjoy life without fear of discrimination. He is a happy man. My friends are still important, as is my sister, neice & step grand-daughter. I love seeing them!

Jealousy is now a main thought in my life. Not for what I have seen, done and achieved, but what others are starting to learn see and do that my age restricts from enjoying their experiences.

WHEN I AM 60 MY HUSBAND WILL BE 62 AND I HOPE THAT WE ARE BOTH STILL IN GOOD ENOUGH HEALTH FOR IT NOT TO IMPACT ON OUR LIVES WHICH SHOULD BE FAIRLY FANCY FREE. I SEE THIS AS OUR TIME TO ENJOY THE FRUITS OF OUR LABOURS WHILE WE ARE YOUNG ENOUGH TO DO SO. I HOPE THAT IF WE HAVE NOT RETIRED ALTOGETHER, WE ARE WORKING A LOT LESS THAN WE DO NOW, BUT STILL WITHIN THE COMPUTER BUSINESS WE HAVE RUN SINCE 1990. IF WE ARE RETIRED WE WOULD STILL KEEP CURRENT WITH TECHNOLOGY AND USE IT HEAVILY, ESPECIALLY COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY AS I FEEL IT HAS A LOT TO OFFER THE OLDER GENERATION. IF THINGS GO AS PLANNED WE SHOULD ENOUGH MONEY TO KEEP A SMALL BASE IN ENGLAND, PROBABLY {PLACE South East England} AS BOTH KIDS LIVE HERE AT THE MOMENT, OR BY THE SEA SOMEWHERE. AS WELL AS HAVING ENOUGH MONEY TO ENJOY TRAVELLING OR STAYING IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. THIS IS A GREAT INTEREST OR OURS. WE EXPECT TO SETTLE IN ENGLAND WHEN OUR HEALTH MAKES TRAVELING DIFFICULT. I EXPECT BY THEN TO HAVE OUR FIRST GRANDCHILDREN, BUT ONLY BY A COUPLE OF YEARS, AS THIS WILL MEAN THAT THE KIDS (WHO LEFT HOME THIS YEAR) HAVE HAD SOME YEARS ON THEIR OWN, TO AMASS SOME BACKING BOTH EMOTIONALLY AND FINANCIALLY, BEFORE BEING TIED DOWN WITH KIDS. I WOULD LOVE TO THINK THAT WE HAVE GOT A LARGE GROUP OF GOOD FRIENDS, BUT IN REALITY I CAN SEE US BEING MORE LOANERS. MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE ALWAYS SHARED EVERYTHING (IN FACT SOME PEOPLE THINK WE ARE JOINED AT THE HIP) AND I CANNOT SEE THIS CHANGING IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS. HOWEVER - I WILL SETTLE FOR JUST GOOD HEALTH!!

At 60 years of age I would hope to still have an active and interesting life. My time may be spent pursuing my present interests of walking (long-distance and hill-walking), gardening and horticulture. Reading books, (rather than watching films or television), would perhaps take up more time. Hopefully, my husband will also be home for us to enjoy life together - travelling, walking, family life. My two children may have their own families with which I can offer help and support. My own mother may need more help. My job as a florist may now have become another hobby - I don't imagine I will have to work unless financial matters change considerably. More likely to be giving time as a volunteer to a charitable concern. My biggest hope, and wish, is that my health is still excellent.

I have worked very hard all of my working life and never been out of work.

Observation ID: N15908U
My life would not have changed that much in 10 years. I will probably still be at work. My husband will still be working.

I am in good health - keeping fit - taking regular walks. Now living in the most beautiful valley in the Black Isle by Inverness. We've always loved Scotland & our summer holidays to the Highlands are so very important to us all as a family, so actually living here is just amazing - Fresh air I would only work occasional hours in a local GP surgery... just to keep my hand in & brain ticking over! We love the grandchildren coming to stay/or going South to see them. Our house would have wonderful views over the valley & I would be quite involved with the neighbours & local events. There is such a fabulous community spirit & I would enjoy being a part of it. {HUSBAND} & I love the local music & we enjoy going to our local village hall for a session with guitars/recorders violins and voices. What fun. Nigel plays golf but I'm not sure if I'd take that up or not. I would keep in contact with our friends from the South & have them to stay/email or keep in touch via email etc. I can't wait. Life would be just great.

Observation ID: N19303M
I expect to be still in full-time employment with another five years until retirement. My mortgage would have been paid off five years previously, enabling me to save/invest more towards my pension. However, should my finances be in better shape than I anticipate, I would like to think that I may be able to work only 3 or 4 days per week and use the free time to do things I haven't yet had the time or funds to do, such as further education; persuing creative interests; and travelling. Having never married or had a partner I don't expect the situation to have changed, but would still be open to the possibility of meeting a long-term companion.@Hopefully, my diabetes would be well-controlled and I won't have developed any debilitating secondary illness. Mentally, I expect to still have an active and alert mind and generally to be in good spirits.

Observation ID: N16067G

Hopefully, I can retire from paid work by the age of 60. Would like to have achieved some goals for example, walking parts of the coastal path in G.B. and starting my own small business. (Most things depend upon the children, as the younges will still only be 19.) Expect health to deteriorate - but only as it will be for everyone else in this age group. Still hope to have many outside interests as I do now. Would like to remain the same shape! As my parents are still both alive and very active, aspects may change if their circumstances alter. They live in the same village and I would not hesitate to look after their (or individual) needs.

Observation ID: N28132M
I have just walked the dogs along the beach as, today, I do not have to go to work as Deputy Head of Psychology at the local FE college. I have been considering my options - whether I might retire or not, can I afford it, do I want to, and try to imagine what my days would by like if every one started with a long walk. What about the weather; what will I do in the winter - a PhD - do I care enough? I wonder if I have anything truly novel to contribute and feel sure someone else wrote of it last year. I think I will have to do something, although I'm likely to see what happens when {HUSBAND} (the hubby) retires. Fortunately I am still in robust health, choosing to ignore the touch of arthritis in the fingers and the weakness in my lower back. I have chosen yoga over aerobics, yoghurt over Aeros & alliteration over youthful ardour; it's really not so bad ...

Observation ID: N14129V
Hopefully I wont be here when I'm 60 as I have no wish to grow old in this country but can't afford to move - however should worst come to worst and I am still around I should imagine I will be doing the same boring job I've been doing for the past few years (I'll not be able to afford to retire!) I'll probably still live next to noisy immigrants who bring down the quality of my free time and disturb my sleep by shouting about at night-time, I'll still be hounded for council tax for a useless council, still struggle to pay gas, electric and water bills and still find grocery shopping more expensive than I can afford - or with a bit of luck - I'll be dead by then!

Observation ID: N12679N
I will probably still be working and hopefully have reasonable health.

Our daughter is enjoying a lucrative career in a corporate law firm. She is very happy, still single but has a longterm partner. We are very happy, healthy & enjoying life.

My children will have left home (although Maybe not permanently - many seem to return after university) so I may have more quality time to spend with my wife. Life should be rather less hectic with more opportunity to do what we want. My mother who I visit pretty much every day may have passed away. She is increasingly infirm and reliant on me for physical & emotional sustance I will miss her very much. I will be financially less secure, facing later life with inadequate pension & savings. I will continue to work until the day I drop (I am an energetic & wrestless person so this holds no fears - I am not the retiring type). I hope my health holds up (I've been very lucky so far) I will worry endlessly about the fate/ life choices / partners my children choose.

I have no idea how I will be living my life at 60, as the way I live it may be out of my control... But I hope that my health will allow me to live pretty much as I do now - I exercise a lot and will continue to do so as long as I am able. I expect to be living in the same house, with the same wife! I hope still to be riding my motorcycle (or a better one!) With the kids grown up I may have more time to pursue interests that I've let lapse - drawing, photography, reading, travel, maybe even get to grips with learning to play guitar (finally) or speaking Italian. I'm, optimistic that my health will continue and expect to be living pretty much as I am now; no happier, being bound by the same values, to responsibilities ... and the views and actions of others in my life over which I have no control or influence. I expect to fulfill my resposibilities to the best of my ability and comfort and enjoyment where I can.

I am keeping active through my hobby of vegetable gardening, and also propagation of flowers and vegetables from seeds. My success with seeds has been reasonably good over the years which is extremely rewarding, long may this continue to be the case. I may still be living in my parents home (unsure about this), as it is located close to the sea, with some refreshing walks along the cliffs only 5 minutes away. Hopefully the fresh clean air on the coast will be beneficial to me, it has considerably improved my asthma, and walking is good for my joints. I am now employed with a local company in {PLACE}, involved in computer work, and my job requires a 15 minute walk to the building, very convenient with no travelling time involved.

This question put me in a quandry as I always maintained that I don't wish to be old when I die! Is being 60 years - OLD?! In my mind it must be because I cannot see that far forward, an this has no connection to feeling low, depression or feeling suicidal - it's just a fact!!

I still enjoy riding my bike, weather permitting each day. My knees play up from time to time but are no worse that they were 20 years ago.

Age 50 Currently Im a self employed science & engineering consultant with penty of freedom to choose to work or not and engage in leasure activities Age 60 I would expect to do occasional science & engineering consultancy out of interest & spend more time on research projects of interest to me. By then I hope to be writing articles regularly for pleasure - non-fiction & fiction, perhaps earning something from it at sometime. Hopefully my health will allow me to continue cycling, hiking, running & beating the locals at Badminton. If time allow & my fingers still work, my piano may get more use. I will always have a great love of nature, the environment and science, even of the news is not good in 2018. My health will probably have declined in that my knees, ankles hips, back etc will crumble a bit more interfering with sports & hiking etc but I will try to overcome even if severe. Like everybody else I dont want any serious illnesses and will do what ever I can to reduce the risks, but I do worry a bit about my health in the future & hope not to get anything major. I will still have ambition, but will hope to have more leasure time. Expect to be with same partner but no kids, 'nature' and time/age will have ended these chances. PERSONAL

Working in my garden looking forward to the next 10 years of being as well as you can at that age. I would have had over my company to others by this time. Which is a care company. So I have been looking after others for many years one way and others. Employing 43 carers looking back I have had a good life in all.

WHEN I AM 60, HOPEFULLY I WILL BE IN FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT I.E. WHERE I AM NOW. MY LIFE WILL PROBABLY REVOLVE AROUND THE CHILDREN (LIKE IT IS NOW), TAKING THEM TO SCHOOL OR WORK, MAKING SURE THEIR FIRST STEPS INTO ADULTHOOD ARE OK. IN TERMS OF INTERESTS, THEY WILL PROBABLY REMAIN THE SAME AS THEY DO NOW. HOWEVER, IF I HAVE MORE TIME, THEN I MIGHT DO MORE READING/RESEARCH INTO HISTORY, SPACE ETC. MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS GOING TO BE MY HEALTH (AND MY WIFE'S). I HAVE CERTAINLY NOTICED A REDUCTION IN MY HEALTH, SO THE NEXT TEN YEARS WILL PROBABLY SHOW A GREATER DECLINE.

Having paid my mortgage off at the age of 50 and receiving a pension, I would like to be in part time employment such as garden maintenance. Being part time would allow me to play golf at least once a fortnight. Maybe, my children may have left the nest by then, in which case we may think about down sizing and moving nearer the coast. As for my health, having taken on retired greyhounds, which I currently support in re-homing and would like to continue into my 60's means that I do daily walks. I would continue to watch my diet habits, but in the main, slow down a bit and take on board that my body is no longer in its 20's.

My health is pretty good, so I can still enjoy my walks in the countryside with my wife and dog, but my life long back problems limit the distances I can comfortably do these days.

I'm still a 30 year old until I see my father in the mirror every morning. Living on my own since my wife left me 8 years ago is the most severe phase I've had in my life. My golf handicap has fallen steadily to 5 but I don't think I'll get it any lower. I still run 5 miles threee times a week and in the same time I managed 10 years ago. I've cut down on my working hours to 40 hours a week. Any less and I wouldn't have the money to maintain my lifestyle. I travel overseas six times a year. Never to the same place twice. I must start putting some money aside for my retirement but theres 30 years left so still plenty of time.

Observation ID: N16883G
I imagine that I would not be working now, my daughter would be 31 and hopefully working as a doctor & married. My son would be 27 with a good job and his own house and possibly married. My youngest would be 23 and maybe still at university or have a good job. It could be that my husband & I are now living at home with all the children living away. He may well be retired and I would like for us to have several holidays/breaks throughout the year, visiting many places. I would hope that I would be more conscious of my health (diet, exercise etc) and have enough money to live comfortably. I am sure that I would still be very close to my sister and brothers and their children too, and health permitting I would be leading a full, varied and active life.

Observation ID: N17575B

Also spare time to volunteer at a local railway preservation society. My angina still sometimes gives me jip but I've had it for 22 years now so it doesn't stop me enjoying myself.

Life is becoming increasingly difficult for us all, the state of the economy, employment, crime rate, housing. I can only say that, I along with many others as we approach retirement years, will still have the lacklustre lifestyle that, overtaxing & increased inflation relieves us of our cash quicker than we can earn it. So gone are the days when you had money left after paying the household priorities! We are constantly supressed by Government, and Dominated by political idiocrisies I am a firm believer of post code lottery, and where you live dictates your future, your health, wealth & lifestyles. Privatisation has destroyed this country, and that of the working class, who have more than paid for a healthier nation. I can only think back to my Mother and Father, & theirs also, having to pawn valuables, and household, to put a meal on the table, 50 years on, and it is no better, except the pawn brokers have gone, and the doorstop loan sharks replace them. I have no hobbies or much interests other then taking care of the home. My health, is poor with various medical conditions, I am at present trying to get back into a return to work programme, with the jobcentre I have not worked for over ten years with illnesses. My life could be better, I am disapointed I have not achieved more at my stage in life.

A place that is free from the P.C. crap that was dragging England through the mire in the 2000's. A place where any money you earn most of it could be kept for you and your family and not given away to freeloaders and spongers thats not prepared to work.

I expect to continue in good health and continue travelling, walking, gardening, visiting friends & family. As I have (ha!) a private pension - I will have to work til I drop so I will be working at least part time probably full, as now. Ideally as a contractor once the children are off my hands (more money). If the right job came up I would move as would my husband. I am not intending to retire as such and if forced into redundancy I will do a late PhD to prevent brain rot. (or work in B&Q - I would have to do something.

I would be on my own, my son would visit often with his family, I would still have my dog, although she would be very old, and not good on here legs just like her owner.

I don't think I would be working, so I would have more time for doing my jig saws, and spending time with my grandchildren, teaching them how to cook & bake cakes.

I would like to think little has changed. If I keep healthy and my business survives this economic down turn, I will be doing the same or more of what I am doing today. Work is varied and interesting and this will only improve or stay the same. I am healthy and plan to become more fit as I have more time. I am in a relationship which is progessing well, if this improves all the better. I travel at least 10 times a year for holidays or short breaks and I will continue to do this. My Son, who has lived with me since my separation 7 years ago, will eventually move out and so I may move or buy a property elsewhere. The next ten years look to be more exciting than the last (or at least the first five!)

I wish I could be fitter health wise and happier. Life just seems a waste. I should have achieved more not only for myself but for my children and given them more. I have felt very restricted and bitter as very often things could have been corrected earlier. My hobbies include photography, wildlife, IT and the study of the Wheather. Working is a absolute struggle because of my diabeties gained whilst in the Army. 75/06 60% spinal, feet problems, Heart opp {2008}. Employers Welfare towards disabilities are disgusting, and very illinformed. My employer is trying its best to get rid of me. (ageism "no such thing") (Disability Discrimination "full of holes that are convenient to government/employers") Iv been told many times if I dont like the job - then go and we'l employ another mug. "Nice" and thats "{COLLEGE}." I seriously predict civil unrest in this country within the next 5 years. Within 10 years everyone will be working in Europe, UK will be Tax haven.

Well at 60 years old I nolonger have to take my son to his judo training sections five times a week. He is 26 years old now and very independent. I still go to support him at competitions though, but he does the driving. I am still working but as I nolonger have to support myself and my son as a single parent. I changed to a job I want to do. It is not as well paid but a lot less stressfull and far more full filling. I also have time in the evenings to go to evening classes, pottery at the moment but maybe next year I will take a language course. Some evenings I even go swimming, not as fast as I used to be, but hey, can still stay afloat. Still take the annual holiday with my sister but I am planning to visit the friends who emigrated years ago. One to Australia and one to New Zealand.

THEREFORE I WILL NOT BE UNDER SO MUCH PRESSURE TO EARN. I DO NOT KNOW HOW FIT I WILL BE AND THIS WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING WHAT I WILL BE DOING. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW OUR MARRIAGE WILL BE ONCE THE CHILDREN HAVE LEFT THE HOUSE AS THEY HAVE BEEN A GOOD REASON FOR MAKING AN EFFORT. BASICLY I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT LIFE WILL BE LIKE.

Assuming 60 is still retirement ge, I would have more time to do more of the things I want to. I would be a member of some sort of rambling club and my walking group. I would probably do at least one night class a week and hopefully go to the gym at least once. My children should have left home by then so the house would be a bit tidier although my husband might still be here but I would have more time to keep it tidy. Hopefully I could spend time with grandchildren. My health will stay good apart from the odd ache, I don't smoke & rarely drink I look after myself usually. If not retired I think I would change my present job poss to a shop environment. If retired I would do some sort of charity shop work, as I have done in the past, or perhaps animal related volunteering.

Observation ID: N14618H
I hope I will be doing some work with children - paid or unpaid. I am still living in the same house with my husband - both boys have fulflling jobs. I still sing in the choir an play my flute and have a busy social life. My health is better - I look after myself sensibly.

I imagine I will be doing a similar job although maybe in a more managerial, less 'hands on', capacity. I hope to be working more from home and less in an office. I imagine my home life to be stable possibly with a partner. I hope that my health continues to be good and that I am still able to go to the gym 3 times a week as now. I imagine that I am able to indulge some of my passions for painting and photography more by having more time to devote to these hobbies. I imaging home to be more comfortable after having spend 10 years investing in furniture and home improvements especially the garden.

As with all famalies, hopefully my children will be settled in good jobs and have moved out, allowing my wife and myself to downsize to smaller property, with a large garden allowing me to buy a dog to take on walks. Buying classis sports car to go on country drive and walks However due to economic crisis, I feel all the money I have put into personal pension is wasted as it is now worthless. I feel that I will have to work as long as my health will allow. Due to my family history of health problems, hopefully I can stay fit as long as possible watch live sport (rugby, football) with my friends. Enjoy meals out with friends, However very unsure of financial future! and whether I'll be able to afford to do things I want.

I have managed to take early retirement due our mortgage ending - and my husband has also managed to cut down his hours. We are able to spend more time with our Grandson, enjoy longer holidays in {COUNTRY Europe} and more time socialising with friends. My knees and back are still bad which stop me doing much exercise, but my husband now have time to take leisurely walks around our village and on our holidays.

At age 60 I hope to have been able to retire from full time employment but would hope to still do voluntary work and/or work part time. I will indulge my love of travel hoping to visit many far away places for longer perhaps than currently possible due to my job. I have many hobbies & interests so will be able to spend more time on these & hopefully take up new interests. I would be happy to be living on my own as I do now but I would be open to new relationships but unlikely to marry again. I enjoy good health but carry too much weight so I would hope to spend more time on diet & fitness when I retire - ideally before then!

Observation ID: N15990E

I will probably still be working as a Physiotherapist in Pain Management and doing some "light" DIY on the side. I see myself still living in Fife but there is a slight possibility that I might move through to the West to be nearer the family. I would love to be able to retire at 60 but unless my financial situation changes - I will need to work to pay my mortgage. I do have some problems with my knee & hip due to hockey & football in my younger days - but my goal is to keep active & keep my weight down in order to stem any more "degeneration". I will hopefully still enjoy my wine & real ale from time to time. I hope that I will be a little less anxious than I am now and that my mood will continue to stabilise as it has been doing for the last 5 yrs.

I can't really imagine being sixty - I keep wondering what I'm going to be when I grow up, as it is. However, I'm hoping that I'll continue to have a happy family life, even though my children will probably have left home. I hope that I'll remain healthy, active + positive + that any health problems. I do have can be managed successfully. I expect I'll still be growing vegetables, reading avidly + knitting at every opportunity. In an ideal world I'd be running my own yarn shop but that's unlikely to happen until I win the lottery.

I think I will be physically healthy and still competent and hope to continue to support my children in their lives (as my mother has done). I will still be a teacher. My work is very important to me. I miss the love and affection and support of a partner but see no reason to develop another relationship, I still feel married though I have been a widow for 5 years now. My mother may well still be alive - she is very strong and her mother lived a long time She will be in her 80's though and probably need significant care. PERSONAL

As the children will have left home, I expect to have more time for holidays, reading and walking/exercise. I plan to be a young 60 - there is no reason not to do everything I am doing now - and more.

Observation ID: N26916D
My interests will probably revolve around the house, I would expect to be a grandparent by then, I still won't be working and my health should be much the same.

Now that I am 60 I feel that life has passed my by. There were so many things I wanted to do when I was younger. I am now not able to do these things due to my age. I now feel even more discontented with my life than I did when I was 50 but at that age I should have chosen to do what I wanted to do for myself rather than pleasing others (wife!)

I'm retired from full time work, but still working a little part-time in the private sector. I am doing some voluntary work in the community. I put a little time aside to do some writing. We are selling the house & buying a smaller place. I have regular breaks abroad, we have a property abroad. I see my children (and grandchildren?) regularly. I am careful what I eat & exercise regularly I still go to thai chi. We have a dog & I take the dog out regularly. I see friends regularly & keep in touch over the internet, by phone & face to face. I am interested in UNCLEAR classes in familiar & new areas (creative writing, drawing or art maybe?). I still sew & knit.

I will still have to work, as since my divorce, my mortgage is not finished till 67! I will have to work full time, rather than part time and so will have a lot less time to pursue my interests - I teach, so have little home time with marking & preparation. I have 2 prolapsed discs in my back, so I expect these to get worse. As I am very sporty, this will be a huge blow. All my children will have left home and if I still havent met anyone, I can see quite a lonely life. Most of my friends here have plans to move out of the S.E to cheaper areas. As a single parent - money is always a worry and an issue. Having to make all the decisions single handedly also increases stress levels.

Observation ID: N15549R
Well I am a very happy married, I wished we had a bit more money as I feel we are working just to pay bills. We both stopped smokeing in April and we can't even save this money. we dont drink, drive, or go out but I am quite happy with life. We would love to renew our marriage vowls in five years time when we have our silver wedding anniversary. My interests are cross stitching, and making cards.

Observation ID: N22352X
"60" I can't believe it. The children have all left home and I now have grand-children to babysit. I still work part-time at the airport, it helps financially and stops me from becoming a couch-potato. I'm to glad I gave up smoking, I feel better and more energetic, I need to be, to take my Cocker Spaniel for long walks. I'm not too old to still enjoy my concerts and shows and like to keep my brain occupied with crosswords and reading. I still haven't met anyone since my divorce, but hope I will always have the love of my children.

I am a healthy individual enjoying life on my pension with my wife who has just retired. I enjoy travelling and visiting my family and Grandchildren. I am proud of my children and feel I did the best for them as they are growing up. I visit many friends frequently on almost a daily basis. I have sufficient money to do most of the things I wish to do. Above all I feel happy and content without the pressures of work to worry me.

I'll be still working full time, unless my knight on his white charger comes to rescue me! - Who Knows!! I'm forever optamistic !! I hope I'll still be able to keep fit, I love to Salsa and go to the gym. My son will be 25 when I'm 60, he wants to travel to Australia & the States competing in Bodybuilding competitions and wants me with him - so I could be in another country!!

Observation ID: N17856H
I hope to be in good health, perhaps still working but looking forward to the freedom of retirement. I hope to be married still with my son independent but perhaps still living at home. I hope to spend more time on travel and hobbies - taking courses and expanding my mind. I would like to go on walking holidays with my husband and do more non-child orientated activities. No more babysitting! I would like to walk the Cotswold Way and Hadrian's Wall. I would like more couple rather than family activities. I see myself still living here and teaching, with the same family set up. More great-nephews and nieces, I hope!

I would imagine still living in my house with my husband. Perhaps not still working at my present Job. Possibly looking after grandchildren, which I would love to do. I would imagine my health to be on a par to how I feel now. Perhaps a little slimmer and possibly more grey hair. I would hope to still be able to enjoy walking holidays on the Lake District, and still be driving and enjoying the same social events. Hopefully some, if not all of our children would have moved into their own homes, be with a partner and there be grand children. I would hope my husband is in good health and be in a part time job. Possible, we would own a caravan in Wales, and continue walking my Dog.

I'm frustrated that I'm ageing because appearance and fitness have been important to me. I'm very proud of the family I've raised - I see that as my greatest achievement. I hope I'm still married as I wouldn't like to live alone. I regret, more than ever, that I've been a smoker since I was 14, I have no intention of giving up now but wish I'd never started. With my increased wisdom I feel very opinionated and often say "I wish I knew then what I know now"! I've fulfilled my dream of living a bohemian life in rural France - back to nature & basking in the love of my family. I don't want to get old and I have a 'living will' so I'm not resussatated.

I hope to be still working full time (or part time if finances allow). I will not have a mortgage! I hope to spend more time sailing and flying and take up new sports. I hope to also still be able to spend time with my sons doing things together or at least see them often if they don't want an old man around.

MY life at 60 would be the same as it is now if I am still at the same job and place of work. I would still be fishing and going out and doing what I wanted to do. I would either be healthier and fitter with my excess weight off or still trying to loose it. I may also take a early Pension and retire at 60. and either emigrated or moved somewhere else. But I also think 60 is only a number that people live by ie 18-21 40 are all numbers and Birthdays people aim to achieve while people think 60-65 mean old age, pension and retirement, but really it should be the time to wind down and do what you want and enjoy yourself, if you are healthy & wealthy enough to do it.

Observation ID: N12606V
I am now 60 years old I have moved to a lovely bungalow with a lovely garden, it is not huge but of moderate size. I have good neighbours who are very friendly, but do not invade my space. I often eat out and visit the local pub for a light beverage. I still enjoy going to the park and a walk at the seaside (with fish & chip) dinner. I am still healthy & able bodied. I am not rich but I am very comfortable on the financial side. I feel my family now appreciate me more I am no longer a bank or a slave to them. I also appreciate them more now.

To imagine I'm 60 years old - I would hope to be in fairly good health - I think my home life would be roughly the same & I would like to think I would still be working though I do believe in that you shouldn't look to far into the future - just take one day at a time - who know's what's round the corner. I think as long as your healthy and have a good home life & family around you - that's what would be important to me.

Observation ID: N14847U
I imagine that I will be psychologically robust enough to cope with life and to continue to make a useful contribution. I will continue to enjoy my family and friends. However, I am very concerned about the state of the environment and I have very little idea of the kind of life that will be available in another ten years. I worry what the future holds for my own children and for young people around the world. I don't expect to be able to retire because I don't have a pension, and I hope that I will still be healthy enough to work. Although I feel reasonably confident about my own abilitites and achivements I think that I will be deeply affected by the difficulties that lie ahead for human kind.

I imagine my life would be much as it is now. I will still be in the same house and still married to {HUSBAND}. Our grand-daughter would be 12 years old and imagine she will be a big part of our lives as she is now. We would take her on holidays and spend as much time with her as we do now, as she lives 5 miles away. I think our close friends would be the same as now. I do not feel I would be suffering from any illness, but one never knows. I like to think I would still be young at heart and able to move with the times. I will be looking forward to retirement but will work as long as I can in order to maintain our lifestyle.

Health - hopefully still well although first signs of arthritis are starting to appear, so may have slight difficulty in some areas as a result. Future will most likely be determined by job status.

My main in interests are archeology and metal detecting but due to poor health I can no longer participate in these activities. Although my husband is 13 years older than me, I hope that we are still together and can continue to lead a comfortable and enjoyable life as we have always done. Due to the economic problems we may be forced to review our expenditure. My health unfortunately will only get worse and I will have had Depression for 45 years by then, so I will find it worse I expect, in dealing with problems and day to day existence. I have been diagnosed with Fibromyealgia (painful joints and muscles) which cannot be cured, only strong painkillers can help. I expect to be finished from employment shortly. I cannot see myself holding down a full or part-time job again, but I may be able to do some voluntary work. Who knows? If I reach the age of 60, considering all the above, it may by that by then I could find myself living alone. I hope that this will not be the case as I have a strong fear of living alone as we have few friends and family.

Despite being overweight I am in good health at 60 and still walking regularly with my husband, exploring different parts of the country. I see my two children regularly and have a good social life meeting old friends for dinner and trips to the theatre. My husband is still working and has resolved the problems of ten years before.

The optimistic version which is nevertheless feasible: Work is going great! I've managed to carve a niche for myself in the literary world - batty but interesting. The publishing deal kind've takes care of the money. I don't do T.V. anymore except for the odd special. I'm teaching more, the phD has helped and, if the back holds out, I'm going for my second Dan Karate grade soonish. The band still meets and we're getting some regular gigs which is great fun. I'm almost good on the guitar now and the songs are still coming. The not-optimistic version, also feasible: No work. T.V. is all youngsters now, my novels aren't selling and my agent isn't returning my calls. So we're broke and arguing a lot. The PhD is no help since all the Uni's want active writers now. My back is now shot to hell and I had to give up karate. The band folded and anyway all my songs got too miserable. Still, there's hope!

I cannot see myself retiring ever. We all know how bad pensions have done in the last 10-15 years and I can't see them any getting better. We have a mortgage where for the first ten years I was the only one working full time and some of this was 15% interest. Both our children went to university over a five year period this wiped out any money we had saved but worth every penny. Money will be the key to our future. This country never thinks of the born and bred working man. I cannot see much change in my future. I don't think we will move (no point). I have always kept myself fit hopefully I always will. My interests may have to change in the future because of financial reasons.

I feel that my health will still be reasonably good and I will do more walking to keep fit. I will still be married. As our children will have just gone 20, I am looking forward to seeing them make their own way in life. We will now be able to have more flexibility as to when we can take our holidays and we may well be looking to move to somewhere quieter, probably to a smaller house. I may decide to work for a few hours either paid of voluntary, mainly for the social aspect.

Having made it to 60, I hopefully will be able to say that since 50 when my youngest son turned 17 and was effectivelly "off my hands" the ability to travel more extensively presented itself. My interest in travel has always been a keen one which without the encoumbrance of young children has meant I could follow with more vigour. Having paid of my mortgage a few year ago, I have had more freedom to travel. I still work full time, but I am considering cutting down to 4 days per week. Accountancy only holds so much interest!

At the age of 60, my ideal scenario would be - My family would be happy, fulfilled and in good health. - My children would be independant, financially secure in jobs they enjoy. - I will have retired, be financially secure in good health and lead an active life - Would like to spend more time touring the world visiting places I have not previously seen & learning about new cultures & people. - Spend more time in the garden and reading. - Visit friends, relatives and family members not seen for a long time

Observation ID: N21995Y
Here I am still working full time and enjoying life, even though money is tight. I am surrounded by the most wonderful friends and family who I can always rely on for love and support and vice versa. I still love being outdoors and go walking with a ramblers club regularly, whilst also enjoying arthouse cinema and the occasional visit to the theartre and music events. I don't want to retire in the forseeable future for financial reasons but providing I stay fit and healthy I look forward to continuous employment and eventually a happy and content retirement.

Observation ID: N14720E
Won't be plastering. I may choose part-time doing light work. Health is good enjoy keeping home in good order, some gardening, looking after my car. Sharing more time with my wife at home. Children enjoying their own lives - not at home anymore. Have weekends away. In-laws hopefully still here but nee to look after them as very elderly - not in a home. Enjoy watching son play football. Daughter has good business in hairdressing, son is landscaper. Both with partners - have grandchildren.

Still working part time Enjoying my swimming walking & cycling. Looking forward to doing a few less hours at work. Health not to bad - aches & pains in joints.

Observation ID: N25438Q
I imagine that my life at 60 will be very similar to my life at 50. Perhaps I will be working only on a self employed basis from home and choosing more what and how I work. I still hope to be with my partner and have more time to share together doing the things we enjoy: basically I hope life will be less pressured. I suppose it is very likely I will be a Grandma by that age and that is another stage of life I look forward to. I intend to keep as fit as possible and hope I will still be healthy.

Observation ID: N23640G

Having moved to France and bought a Farm with land and numerous out-buildings, these have finally been converted into Gites and our business has taken off. Each morning I collect the eggs whilst my husband sorts out the two cows, sheep and goats. Then its in the kitchen making the fresh bread. the Grandchildren have just gone back after their months holiday and then the whole family will be back for Christmas and the New Year, there doesn't seem to be enough hours in the day to do all we want, but we have never been healthier and so relaxed. Life is very good.

I write this after 4 weeks unemployment, so I hope I am working in a fulfilling job paying a salary that allows me to save for retirement, but also increase my social activities. My big hope is that both of my children have successfully completed their university courses & are in full time employment with reasonable success so far in their careers. The health of my wife & I are important, I would expect to be able to visit a health club a few times a week to allow us both to be active in other areas, e.g holidays etc. We may be grandparents so being physically able to assist would give great joy as well as a benefit to our children.

Observation ID: N12690H

I suspect nothing much will have changed from my current situation. I expect to still be working but am unsure where that might be as I've only recently had a big change (voluntary redundancy, but was able to get another job). I hope my interests/recreation will continue to be active - I have quite a few friends who are very active in their 60s! My father died at 56 (so I hope I haven't inherited that!) However my health is generally very good (but then again, so was his!) so am hopeful that this may continue.

Observation ID: N23563L
At 50 yrs old, I hope that when I'm 60 I could do the same thing as I am now. I enjoy my family life, my wife and home arrangements are fantastic. Both my teenage children could be more organised/tidy, but overall 'No' complaints. Work is good, my walking interest keeps me healthy and my weight down. When I'm 60 there will be no children at home. I'll miss them but the home will be tidy!! Perhaps my wife & I could go on holiday more often.

Observation ID: N12698R
LIFE AT 60 IS A MUCH SLOWER PACE AND PEACEFUL, AS MY CHILDREN HAVE LEFT HOME, LEAVING MORE TIME FOR MY HUSBAND AND I TO DO WHAT WE WANT AT ANY TIME. MORE HOLIDAYS AND WEEKEND BREAKS AS WE HAVE MORE MONEY TO SPEND ON OURSELVES. THIS WAY OF LIFE MAKES ME FEEL CALMER AND RELAXED. MY GENERAL HEALTH IS GOOD APART FROM A FEW ACHES AND PAINS DUE TO GETTING OLDER. HAVING GRANDCHILDREN TO LOOK AFTER KEEPS ME MENTALLY ALERT AND FEELING YOUNG AND FEEL THAT SOMETIMES THIS IS AN UNPAID JOB.

Observation ID: N28118P

My few words on reaching three score years. Firstly I would not want to tempt fate & presume I shall live that long. As I sit here in my lorry cab writing this on Sunday 2.15pm hopefully doing something similar which would be a good sign. For the above to have happened my DNA would have held out I would avoided serious injury & my life style wouldn't have ended my life. On these happy words I wish you well, keep up the good work. Regards TC 14th September 2008

At 60 years old I imagine I will still be living in the same village. I will most likely be living in a different house, having sold the one im in at present and purchased a smaller one that I could possibly extend and renovate. I will be with my wife, my children will most likely now have left home. I hope that I will have the same circle of friends and socialise much the same as I do now. I hope that I will still be in good health and doing the same job, but possibly reduce the amount of hours I now work. I hope my children will be persuing their own desired careers and be both happy and healthy.

Observation ID: N21438Y
At 60 I expect to have retired from the type of job I have been doing most of my life. I expect to be spending more time with my wife pursuing activities that job and family life have thus prevented. More disposable income would allow a better life style with increased leisure time. I would expect my health still to be good and not prevent me from enjoying early retirement. I don't expect to have to work to support my life style, but would not preclude that possibility in some gentle capacity.

Observation ID: N15342C
I still lead a busy, active life, supporting my husband who is a Minister in the church of England & having my own ministry in the church ! My eldest daughter 26 is married and expecting her first baby and I am looking forward to helping her when it is born. This is helped by the fact that my second daughter helps me run the riding school & does a lot of the physical work which I find hard now because of my arthritis, although I still teach & have overall charge. The dog rescue is well established and financially stable. The experience I have gained over the last ten plus years means it runs more smoothly & we have a good reputation of integrity.

I have taken careful stock of my finances (thank heaven my investments recovered from that awful time 10 yrs ago) & feel I can afford to make arrangement with my Practice to do just a few locum sessions when they need me (& I want to). I have a kind & helpful partner (so glad I divorced 10 Y ago but it took along time to recover), the 2 children have lovely babies & I want to be a helpful interested grandma, the free bus pass & train pass will help. I will do lots of travelling perhaps spend the winter months abroad... I am in excellent health still, still doing Yoga & singing in the Choral Society, now have more time for days out, playing the piano, reading all these books.... time for friends and family at last!

When I am 60 I intend to still be developing, maintaining my business. I intend to enjoy the property bought 10 years ago at 50! I intend to have people in place in my business so I can get time to travel. I intend to still be active and in good health. Hopefully my husband who is 10 years older will be able to enjoy these things with me - problem of age differences. I hope to have expanded my social circle as at 50 it revolves around young children/parents/saff in my Pre School. (Work in the U.S is hard with few benefits in comparison to England - the harsher conditions for the working population and harsher social UNCLEAR/unemployment structure is possibly needed in the U.K. These aspects hamper life as I know it).

I am living in the same neighbourhood, I may have moved to a larger house. This house provides guest bedrooms, dining room, music room or library and one or two acres of land. Our children visit regularly, they have 'good' jobs & happy relationships. They may stay over in our 'guest bedrooms'. I collect eggs from the chickens in our garden, I collect fruit veg & herbs from our garden also. I continue to work and still cannot imagine ever retiring. I teach very little now, but continue to run our family business with my husband. The work continues to be challenging and fulfilling. There are healthy financial rewards. I do not ever worry about financial security. We can support our children and their families if necessary. I travel regularly, I am remember, free from the work load burden of teaching. I may have a property in france. Towards the south where the summers are warm. Here I would relax, read paint chat with friends & family. The world I live in is dark, I am watched by cameras as I move around the neighbourhood. I am not allowed to drive a car of my choice, it is difficult for most People to survive financially. Bills are high and govt penalties are many. Luckily I live my life in this world with my husband by my side.

I am now 60 years old and life is much quieter than it was 10 years ago. I am no longer so much involved in my children's activities as I am no longer needed as their taxi driver. But I am still involved with their lives as I babysit for their children when needed. I still manage the letting of my houses, from advertizing, interviewing, to the day to day managing. I find that painting and decorating these houses between tenants is taking me longer as I am not as strong as I used to be, but I still manage. My house is tidier now that my children have left home and I am not spending so much of my time on housework. I still struggle mowing the lawn but this has always been an effort. In all, my life is quieter and tidier. I have more free time as I am not involved in my children's clubs any more. But family is still very important to me and we meet often.

I hope I will be healthy but I've been healthy all my life and I do wonder whether all my ailments will combine into one big one! I don't know whether I will be living at the same address - due to the present economic climate - but I would like to think I might be living near the coast.

I am still very active, keeping up my hobbies and outdoor interests. I am doing more travelling because I have more time after retiring. My grandchildren take up more of my time which I enjoy. I will be doing a small part-time job just for interest and pocket money. I still have my aches and pains but I put these down to staying active. I am still interested in learning and have completed some courses on subjects I am interested in such as the natural environment. I will have done quite a bit more sailing but my deteriorating eye-sight makes reading detailed charts and documents difficult. My wife and I have grown closer to each other and have more time to spend together. We do not have any financial worries and are enjoying life more than 10 years ago.

Hopefully at the age of 60, our mortgage will just be paid and retirement will either have happened a couple of years ago or about to happen. Money issues should not be a real problem as we should have a comfortable income from the company pension, and we do not have extravagant tastes. As a cardiac arrest struck me at the age of 50, realisation of the importance of living healthily has hit hard in terms of eating correctly and exercising. We regularly attend a gym and intend doing so at 60 and beyond. We would be looking to live near the coast as we both enjoy walking and cycling and would be doing more of these exercises at 60. Our holidays in our caravan would become regular and money permitting we would enjoy more of the world.

Observation ID: N27385C
The fact my children are not longer in full time education has allowed me to give up work, I have been looking forward to the time when I would stay at home without feeling guilty about not contributing to supporting my family. Although my husband told me to be a stay at home Mum when the children were still at school I felt it wasn't an option as we had too many commitments, especially school fees. Now I really feel relaxed and appreciate my free time. I am still busy running the home, garden and meeting up with friends, but the fact that my days are no longer spent running the children around, checking they are keeping up with their studies and meeting their deadlines. I now have time to pamper my husband, cook for him and invite family and friends over regularly to socialise without the worry of cost or time. My husband is also retired and we are travelling the world, experiencing new cultures meeting new friends and enjoying the benefits of all our hard work. Being in a position to help our children and be part of their lives is extremely important to me.

I anticipate that both of my children will be carving out their own careers, and I hope that they will both find happiness with partners and children of their own.

Now I am 60 I feel very lucky to have the life I have now. Although I was on my own while the children were growing up. Tax credits etc helped me and we could still afford a nice house and holidays abroad. I now have a lovely man in my life and having paid off my morgage we can do lots of things together. I still make some curtains and work part time as self employed but also have time for my healing (recki, herb and heath) to help others, and my music - dance and playing guitar and piano. With the shift in the earth's plates and axis at the end of 2012, and colapse of banking and money systems, this caused havoc at the time but people have returned to the more important things in life - caring for each other, comunity love has returned and people now find fun in the simple things in life rather than the materialistic vices of the past. life has had many changes, but people now salve each other and many are happier. Its so nice to be out of the rat-race and the Children are happy in their lives. Now we are all 51, the survey you have done would be very interesting from an astrology point of view. We are all sun in pisces with mercury (the way we think and comunicate) there too. Many of us later in the UNCLEAR will have had mercury square saturn which could have given us difficulties in comunication, writing and spelling early on in life. With Jupiter, Neptune and the north node in scorpio square our Venus and Uranus opposition we have all had our lessons to learn in our own depth, UNCEAR and truth and has to combine that with what we value in relationships with others and our own individuality. There will have been certain times over the years that may have been turning points or difficult times in our lives for simalar reasons. In experienced astrologer could look into this and would know what questions to ask for research. Hope you find this interesting PERSONAL

When I am 60 I expect to have the same interests as now, which are gardening, studying with the OU, travelling, voluntary work with Cats Protection and geneology. However, because I will be retired from work and my daughters have left home there should be more time to pursue these interests although I expect to have pressure of time with childcare of grandchildren and care for elderly in laws. I hope to downsize my house at 60 and live in a bungalow. With regard to my health I hope to be well and doing everything possible to keep that way by regular checkups, healthy eating and gym membership.

Hopefully my husband will still be alive. However I do not expect the arthritis in my back and hands to get better, so I am 60 and feeling fed up with being disabled. I had to lose two toes on my feet a couple of years ago, because of my diabetes. My marriage is still strained as my husband feels more like a carer than a partner. I have lost all contact with my few friends, as I never have the energy to go out. I am very worried about my 3 sons, and how they will cope when I die, although I am trying to be optomistic that they will be happy and healthy.

At 60 years of age my interests and hobbies would more or less still be the same. Playing chess is my main interest and should this not be possible anymore, then at 60, depending on my circumstances a big gap would have appeared, but I'm sure there are plenty of things to keep me occupied (reading, swimming) My home life would (or at least should) have changed due to our daughter no longer being at home (17). Maybe some grand-children would have appeared, in which case my life would have altered considerably from now. I am worried about my health at 60, as I smoke and seem unable to stop, even though I've tried many times. My job at present is quite physical and my back is another concern at that age. Hopefully I would have retired by then due to us down-sizing our property. So at 60, I'm a grand-father and husband, with a healthy bank balance, still doing the things I like.

Home Life - my kids will range from 16-25yrs so maybe a couple will have left home. Financially I doubt if I will be better off, having at least two of them having gone through expensive further education. I would like to think that at work things will have improved to such an extent that I can look forward to retirement more positively, although I doubt it. I will have continued to run my Scout Troops albeit with more help from younger people. Healthwise I hope to be much as I am now, perhaps & little improved, suspected problems would probably be either teeth or circulation (mainly in my legs). I would prefer to be more relaxed generally and may be even do some thing creative, like write a book.

Observation ID: N16537R
THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT QUESTION. IS IT WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO BE DOING OR WILL PROBABLY BE DOING. THE LATTER IS COMPLETELY DOMINATED BY THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CLIMATE. THE RATE AT WHICH THE CURRENT DOOM & GLOOM IS NOW AT WOULD AFFECT ME QUITE CONSIDERABLY. MY HUSBAND BEING A CONVEYANCER (PROPERTY LAWYER) WHO IS EMPLOYED BY SOMEONE ELSE COULD LOOSE HIS JOB AT ANY MOMENT. THAT WOULD RESULT IN THE HOUSE BEING REPOSSESSSED AND AS THE HELP PEOPLE LIKE US ARE ACTUALLY GIVEN I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. WE HAVE NO CONTINGENCY PLANS SO LIKE MANY OTHERS I REALLY WOULD NEED A CRYSTAL BALL TO DETERMINE THIS ONE. I KNOW THIS HAS NOT BEEN VERY HELPFUL BUT IF I COULD BE 75% SURE OF WHERE I WOULD BE THEN PERHAPS THIS WOULD REFLECT ON SOME OF MY ANSWERS TO PREVIOUS QUESTIONS.

Mainly I hope that I'm still here to fill this form in as a 60 year old. My health is good but I am overweight, have slightly high blood pressure, an underactive thyroid and because of long hours working in highly pressurised job, a fear of a heart attack having had both parents suffer heart problems. I imagine I will still be working (health allowing) in the same demanding job. In ten years time our children will be 32 and 28 and I hope to be a Grandparent and spending as much time as possible being a grandad. My interests remain my lifelong ones of football, strongly left wing politics, literature, theatre, music and the environment. Any positive commitment I am able to make in the future (as directed by my interest) would be directed towards the environment particularly in supporting animal rights groups.

Observation ID: N20797Q
At 60 I will have retired from teaching. Hopefully, I will still be experiencing good health & be fit & active. I would probably have stopped playing netball(!) & may have taken up golf more seriously.

I am 60 - my son is 22 and (may) still be living at home, as he cannot afford to live anywhere else. My health has deteriated, due to stress, caused by my job, and lack of exercise and fresh air, caused by the fact that as a single parent who is afraid to drive anywhere other than locally, and having a son who is weaker, due to cancer, and lacks interest in the outdoor life, I have not had a chance to walk/swim/run etc. I am struggling to survive financially -(I may well already have died) I will be working to pay off mortgage, so I can secure the house for my son's mortgage/future. As I age, the chance of ever meeting someone who wants a relationship with me diminishes - because men of my age want a woman at least 10 yrs younger. I may now have the chance to learn another language, go to night school, do more exercise (but it maybe too late)

Too "Mills and Boon" a question for me - sorry! In my professional life I have always resisted the challenge of the unexpected, and so I look forward to being surprised by what I will be doing at 60, and of relishing the opportunity - whatever 'it' is. Hopefully we will be enjoying each other's company as much as we do now, and that of the kids - and who knows, grandkids by then. As far as it is in my power I intend to be fit and healthy. My outlook is Carpe Diem - seize the day - and live fully in the present moment, so pondering ten years hence is a non-starter! So enjoy life is not a Dress-rehearsal.

Observation ID: N13284B
By the age of 60 I hope to have already retired 5 yrs. Would be looking to my wife {WIFE} to also retire. The youngest children (the twins) would be 26 the other two 29 and 31 all will have left home. This could be a time for a massive change, a move down south, to the coast perhaps even a place abroad its something we have discussed. Health would have to be a consideration. If the money market recovers from the current situation I think my finances wouldn't be an issue. We would spend time doing things no restrictions, that were previously there. Walking, visiting places of interests, eating out more having a good time meeting making new friends. If a move to a different location does not materialise then our time would be spent closer to home, gardening, doing more or less the same but in England close to hand hopefully for the grandchildren, all this would be depending on our health. Money can't buy it also can't buy you time.

Observation ID: N26244L
MY LEISURE INTEREST IS IN WILDLIFE, particularly birdwatching and photography. Subect to the unknowns of jobs and family commitments, the intention is to move to the Norfolk Coast.

I would like to think that be the time I am 60 I will be able to shorten my working week, take more time off, and enjoy my social interests. My children will be enjoying the prime years of their young adulthood and the time and money that this frees up will give me new scope to enjoy such delights as sailing. I recognise that my health will not be as good as at 50, but I hope this will not limit my enjoyment of the wonderful things in life. I think this change in family focus may change my relationship with {WIFE}, my wife, but this is a challenge that we will will face together and work through together, as we have always done when faced with change.

So its Xmas 2018, I have another incurable cold, I continue to feel overweight & promise myself to diet tomorrow. The mail arrives & as I bend down my knees creek & my back aches & I wonder if exercise would have improved the joints. but I remind myself that the fittest people I know have undergone heart surgery or smoke 60 a day. Theres a card from my wife enjoying life with her 'mother' in New Zealand - the children have also moved out there to escape the escalating cost of student loans now approaching £30,000 each, which is probably why Africans continue to flood in to take their place. I boil the kettle for China Tea & have a bowl of cereal for breakfast & take something out of the freezer for dinner - tonight its UHT meat from ZXZ506 & home grown vegetables. {COLLEAGUE} phones to tell me we have work 500 miles away installing equipment on public transport. I go outside feed the birds, clean the droppings off the solar panels & have a quick glance at the wind generator. The car is charged up & ready to go. I wonder what uncontrollable pests are going to eat my home grown veg this year.

I would like to still have a base in {PLACE South East England} - possibly the same house that I am in now - but would ideally like to live predominantly in, say, {COUNTRY Europe}, where I have a 2nd house now.

I train every day and want to stay as fit as possibly in a warm, friendly and relatively UNCLEAR environment surrounded by Portugese people in their own country.

I will be able to work still and hope to be still in the same job, which I really enjoy. I may have moved house & area as my husband may have changed jobs.

I am working part time now, and the children will have finished university and be settled in a job. I am healthy and trying to stay fit by exercising regularly. I enjoy an active social life with many friends who I like to spend time with. I am interested in travelling and hope to have more time to do so. I enjoy going to the theatre and eating out. Myself and my husband have more disposable income to enjoy the things we like doing.

I hope when I am 60 I have enough money to choose whether I work or not, my health would be very important to me being active and able, would be a priority. I have taught Martial Arts for most of my life and that would be important for me to be able to continue, Its hard to imagine not being active but even now at 51 I am beginning to feel retricted slightly. I am not looking forward to being old. I really do believe in quality opposed to quantity and thats what I want in life PERSONAL

Spending more leisure time and only working part time. Would hope to have enough money to travel around. Would hope my health is such that I would be quite able to pursue my interests. Although I feel that the reality will be that my financial situation will always tie me down.

I would love to imagine that my kids would all be settled in jobs & leading their own lives. I hope to meet someone in the mext 10 years who I can retired with & enjoying life together in semi/retirement. That we could devote more time in our christian ministry & seeing this beautiful world that we live in. I cant see myself living in this house, maybe some thing smaller where we didn't have a mortgage. If I don't find a partner I aim to do this on my own & with friends. I may have a little job if I still need a suplement income but only part time. This is all hoping that time & health ravages hold up. - watch this space - The new system that I'm praying for may be here instead.

Observation ID: N18390Y
I am now 60 years old. I cannot work due to problems with my back. Problems that I have had to endure for over 10 years. My life is held in the balance of how much pain I am in from one day to the next as to where and how far I am able to travel (walking). I see no hope of getting better as the Quality of NHS is only getting worse due to the lack of funding.

Observation ID: N25113W

Observation ID: N16905V
I have endeavoured to keep fit & healthy although my joints (particularly lower back & hips) are slowing me down slightly, however, as I suffered and since recovered from breast cancer in 2006, I feel lucky to be alive. I still play badminton, even if I'm not as spritely as I was 10 year ago, it is more of a social thing. I still jog when I feel up to it & walk the dog. I also belong to an art group. I have a few grandchildren now, all under 10 years old and we visit & are visited by them & their parents (our children) to whom we are very close. this will be our 41st wedding anniversary, which we feel is a great achievement considering the divorce rate. We will soon be selling this largeish house we brought our children up in, to release some capital to retire with, as the pensions my husband paid into privately have not come to much and the state pension is inadequate. I might carry on working part time as I enjoy going out to work and it gives me a feeling of self worth.

I do not expect to have any serious illness's but who knows what is around the corner

Observation ID: N24520D
I can only imagine my life at sixty being the same as my mum's retired and at home all day on my own with no longer my husband as he died and with no proper support (money ect.) The truth is my mum married an alcholic and second time round so did I without knowing and over the years things have got pretty bad and I think I will end up the same a lonley old woman in a one bedroom flat with not a lot to spare but will have my grandchildren whom I adore but at least I no I am loved.

Observation ID: N27956R
I am still living in the same house with {PARTNER}, my partner. Maybe we've finally got married, but it's not that important either way. But we're also spending more time in our second home - we've sold our caravan in West Wales, with some regret, but we've been able to buy a small cottage in France. We're also still having great holidays all over the world - with the mortgage paid off there's more money for holiday pot! I'd like to be retired, but because {PARTNER} can't retire before next year, I'm still working part time. I'm also doing some voluntary work for a charity - it's nice to have the time to give something back. I still do a bit of freelance proof-reading too. I'm still very lucky with my health - a few aches and niggles, but nothing to worry about. Now I'm not working full time, we've got a dog, and she gets me out walking every day. I'm doing more home cooking, and growing vegetables in the garden

When I am 60 years old the mortgage will have been paid for a few years and I expect to be working with my husband running camping & caravan sites in {COUNTRY Europe} or Scotland.

I hope to have retired from teaching. I would continue to see family and friends on a regular basis and have Grandchildren To have regular visits to the gym for classes, swimming and walking Guests would visit some weekends and I would travel more frequently. It would also be great if my health was good and I did not need to worry about money because my pensions were good.

I do not think (hopefully) much will change. I will continue to work, I hope I will be able to keep-up with change. Work for me is important. As a shy person who lives a relatively reclusive life in a remote location, its how I connect with people. I hope my health remains, it concerns me and I would like to do something about it, I must stop smoking. I would like to be hapy & contented I cannot imaging or contemplate being alone for the rest of my life.

Observation ID: N12015C
I hope to still have lots of energy and enthusiasm to do the things I want to do at 60. Our children will feature greatly in our lives and seeing them and sharing time with them would be important. I try to be sensible about diet and fitness to a degree so at 60 I would like to maintain that. Travelling would feature highly in my life. Maybe more hobbies such as photography or painting also tennis walking, swimming. Work would be reasonably important as I should have more time with the children being self-sufficient. Maybe some voluntary work. Need more room!

Observation ID: N28090U
I am looking after my children & grandchildren still, but less often. I would now like to have more time to do more social activities and enjoy my life more.

Observation ID: N22342V
I expect to be living on my own with deteriorating health and fitness. I will be working, if I am lucky, in a part-time, low-paid job as I dont have the skills that are required in the 'new economy'. I expect my children to be struggling partly as I have failed to instill in them the dedication they need to succeed and partly as jobs will be scarce due to overseas competition. A possible plus is the opportunity to participate in past-times requiring limited expenditure (reading, writing, bird-watching) provided that health problems do not cause me significant problems. I expect money to be limited and that my pension to be impacted by the loss of at least one of my current pension plans due to economic difficulties. Despite seeing these problems I do not seem to have the ideas to take action to improve beyond saving all that I can at present.

Observation ID: N14292F
Hopefully my children will be healthy, happy and settled in their careers/jobs and have their own transport. This would allow me more time to persue my interests- Also hopefully being healthy, having a stable and comfortable financial sutuation myself I would still like to be in employment - to keep mind and body active - but only part time which would enable me to travel more.

I will still be playing music with friends going to concerts and visiting friends. I will still be living in the same tiny house but everything will be orderly and the garage may be converted to provide a small studio area. I hope my children will be working in their chosen professions but do not imagine they will be property owners, and I am not expecting grandchildren to have appeared by then either.

At the age of 60, I would like to be active and participating in clubs, sports, and doing charitable work. I expect to be working in my nursing job because of the need financially but also because I feel I can contribute effectively still to caring for sick children as I am compassionate.

Semi-retired and enjoying more leisure time though not as well off as I would have liked financially In good health generally though I have slowed down somewhat and do not have as much energy as I would like to have. Workwise mostly doing consultance and training as well as managing a small property portfolio. Enjoying the garden more as I do not have so many time constraints. Travelling quite a lot catching up on the places we have not visited so far. Still married and having more time for each other.

Observation ID: N25341G

My future has very recently changed having just lost my mother. Its hard to see beyond the next day at the moment! I would like to think my health in relation to my diabetes remains the same. As my partner is poorly at the moment I cannot say where I would be at 60 - hopefully still with him. My two neices will be married and have their own children who I would be heavily involved with I'm sure. My aunt will be 93 and still living at home in reasonable health. Our two cats would be getting old but, no doubt still carrying on the same as now - just slower. I would still be working - probably part time whether I would be working as a project leader for HBOS - no one can say!

Observation ID: N12659J

I am still very healthy and happy. I don't see my son as often as I would like as he travels a lot and teaches sailing, but hope to live nearer to him when he starts having children - (if).

Observation ID: N19715D
I would hope by now to be completely happy and content with home, life in general. I hope to still be happily married and able to share our free time together enjoying being together. I would hope to be well, mentally and physically. I hope our home is finally completed re-decoration, furniture etc., so that we can relax & enjoy being there. I would like to think I may be involved in voluntary work rather than paid employment or a job which I thoroughly enjoy. I would want to feel stressless, and enjoy every day. I hope to have people who are like minded as friends. I would like to be pursuing ballroom dancing with my husband. I would ideally like my husband to be retired in order to pursue interests together.

I am still working at the same job, probably full-time and probably looking forward to retirement (hopefully at 65!). My health is maybe the best it has ever been (having discovered I was coeliac at age 42 - after over 30 years of poor health because it had gone undiagnosed and contracting M.E. at age 43 and made slow recovery). I still live alone but spend a lot of time with my children (who are now parents themselves) and friends. I like cooking/sewing/knitting/maybe other crafts/keeping fit through dance/walking. Depression is still lurking but less of a problem.

Observation ID: N19298H

Observation ID: N16436M
I fear my mother may have died by the time I am 60, so the house we share will have been sold. I will probably be living alone in the West London area, though I hope to have found a partner before then to be sharing life/home with. I may possibly have moved to the USA to live with my brothers family. I expect to be still working in some capacity. My interests (still) will be gardening, local theatre group, D.I.Y., animals, eating out, relaxing with television. I will have totally stopped smoking and expect my health to be reasonable, though assume the natural ageing process will have given rise to some aches and pains. My mother is now 84 and when she dies I will be affected hugely. Depending on when this happens, my mental well being may be at an extremely low ebb, or less so, when I reach 60. If she is still alive in 10 years time, she will be 94 and I will probably be in a position of caring for her. I would in that instance be hit hard mentally and find it deeply sad and stressful. If I were to meet someone in the meantime, my life at 60 would be a lot happier than if I don't find myself in a relationship I will, I hope, still have my two cats!

I will be growing vegetables and should have had the opportunity to retire but expect to work on a bit. I will pursue the Arts with respect to music & literature. The only reason the above would not occur (barring accidents/illnesses/unforseen circumstances) is that one or more of the children have had children themselves and I find myself looking after them a lot and perhaps they may not have left home as that is financially difficult.

When I'm sixty .. to be honest I find (and have always found!) it hard to make this kind of projection. I really don't spend time thinking about that kind of distant time horizon personally (professionaly I do, but not for myself.) However, if I'm forced: I envisage being in employment (and therefore economically comfortable), probably in health policy / research arena. Home life: probably living with my husband, though depending on work circumstances perhaps we may have two domestic locations (one for me/him during the working week away from "home") Our daughter will be 26. Probably she won't yet have children so I don't envisage we'll move to be near her. That's something we see for our 7th decades! Interests: have decided to start trailing the coastal paths of UK this year. I imagine that will still be something I'm trying to do! And I want to have a way of offering skills to local charity - I imagine committing time to that. Friends will feature as importantly as ever. They will be the core of our social life, as now.

I hope he is working fewer hours/retired so we can do more together eg. learn a new language, become volunteers with the National Trust some voluntary work. More time for hobbies eg. paino, gardening. Not certain my health will be as good as currently - arthritis is a problem in my family, so that's likely. Financially, we should still be very comfortable. Plans to travel more extensively. Not sure whether we'll move house - it depends on what our new neighbours are likely (most of them are currently in their 80s)

I am as healthy as ever (eyesight not as good as I'd like!) and feeling fulfilled by a life full of productive work and some achievement in a profession (photography) that has seen the technological revolution of digital continue to unfold. I am still working, still collaborating with my many friends and colleagues, and expect the same in another 10 years...

I am very unlikely to be alive at 60 - I have both a brain tumour and metastic breast cancer. In the event I am alive I hope to be retired and be having quality time with my family and helping them be happy and settled. My health is not likely to be good and this is likely to limit my activities.

I enjoy meeting friends for a catch up and a drink although I drink a little too much. I miss work but try to get more involved on a voluntary basis than I had time for before. I have no money worries.

Observation ID: N16976L
I have very little idea what my life will be like in 10 years time. I have no idea waht work I will be doing and whether I will be living in the uk. It's possible that I might be married, it's possible I might be already dead. At 50, I am unemployed and have no recent work experience so that career directions are not strongly under my control. It's unclear to me whether I will have the drive to find something that makes sense for me or merely fall into a low-status and unrewarding role that brings low income and low sense of achievement. This outcome is liable to condition all others. I am still poor at taking on risk so may repeat past errors and settle for the safe and unrewarding.

Observation ID: N20819D
Still be able to do most of what I do now albeit a bit slower maybe. Children will be settled and possibly have their own families which I hope to be some part of. Apart from actually aging I hope most things will still stay the same.

At 60 I hope to be lucky enough to be retired or maybe working just a few hours a week. I would like to have more free time by then to do some voluntary work with animals. I would like to be fit enough to enjoy my garden, walking and travelling. I look forward to having grandchildren. I have a bit of arthritis in my hands & feet and hope that doesn't progress or that there maybe a cure by then.

Observation ID: N22710Z
I expect to have received at least 2 promotions in my working life. My daughter will be nearly seventeen and still at School so life will be very much governed by this. I expect to be in a different house and different area to where I am now.

Observation ID: N17532Q
I hope I will still have good health in order for me to carry on working maybe part-time, so that I can then spend more time with other leisure interests that I cannot do at the moment due to working full time. Life is for living so I wish to get out there and enjoy it.

Observation ID: N18639E
I spend a good deal of my time in "creative" pursuits: painting (an exhibition or two?) Sculpting, writing, (a book in the making?) I have more time for myself, one daughter still based at home, (at University/art school?) {HUSBAND} still working but less in London, Grandchildren have started to feature but I've done lots of childcare in my life and the occasional work/painting day/overnight keeps me in touch with them. I have done further studies in counselling/mentoring and use these to earn a bit but also engage in a wider world. Health good except for continuing knee/lower back UNCLEAR but keeps me concentrating on fitness. I swim, bicycle, (holidays are walking, cycling, some skiing), pilates. Birdwatching & gardening still take lots of time. See friends from further away more again now, family are adults, voluntary work increased.

I am working as an Air Traffic Controller at {WORKPLACE Airport}, although retirement is just around the corner. I still ride motorcycles and now spend time rebuilding & restoring them. Golf is still a mjor part of my leisure time and so is my kayaking. My health remains good, although my joints sometimes play up - but not enough to curtail my activities! Life is good!

Observation ID: N27952M
My aspirations were to have given up my job with the same employer since I left school at 16 and to be drawing my pension doing some part time work that actually interests me but with no responsibilities. This would have including paying off the mortgage & spending time travelling with the wife. The changes appear to be lining up to prevent me ever achieving such ambition. The endowment will leave a big hole in the mortgage, having paid into my pension for so long the rules are changing that now require I work for longer & leave with less. However my biggest fears are for my children - can they afford anything like the lifestyle we have experienced. I can see them relying upon us for longer both financially & for practical help and assistance with child minding. My own health has taken a downward step over the past 5 years - Too much weight & blood pressure & of late problems with motorbiking with my knees & hips in particular. My wife has diabetes & her own health issues. At present I am finding it difficult to break what has become a routine around work to find time to address my health problems. In 10 years time unless I take action I will have progressed further down the track reducing any possibility of recovery. For years I have been telling myself that things will eventually get better - I will find the me time to do the things I want to do. When I get to 60 I expect to still be looking.

I feel I have made so many mistakes in my life I just need to hope for the future. Life has taught me a big lesson I feel I have more insight into who I am. I know now that I am a kind and good person I don't have nasty thoughts I am soft and always worrie about everyone else that's been my life. My health has given me a lot of worries but my children are my life and my grandchildren our the future if only you could put an old head on young shoulders I love my family so much and without there help I would be so sad. I know that money can't buy happiness and also that you can't love people to much. If you care as I do, that can sometime bring sadness but most of the time Great Happiness.

I'D LIKE TO IMAGINE WHEN I'M 60 THAT I'VE MAINTAINED MY HEALTH - WITHOUT GOOD HEALTH MOST THINGS IN LIFE ARE AFFECTED. I'D STILL LIKE TO BE IN A HAPPY & LOVING RELATIONSHIP WITH MY CURRENT PARTNER & BE FINANCIALLY STABLE TO RETIRE AND ENJOY RETIRED LIFE. HOWEVER, IF FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT PREVAILES IT WOULD STILL GIVE ME A REALISTIC OBJECTIVE & MOTIVATIONS TO LIVE LIFE.

Observation ID: N13039Q
Ten years ago, I anticipated that, at this point, I'd be settling into a nice early retirement! Oh how wrong could I have been !? The last ten years have seen hundreds of thousands wiped off my savings and it now looks like I'll have to work until 70! If only as a consultant. On the upside, my health is great I'm fitter than I have been for 15 years. My home life is as good now as 10 years ago and I have a wonderful family life. All in all, nothing to complain about - apart from not having quite the freedom I wanted but at least the UK is sorting itself out, finally.

Observation ID: N16904U
I HOPE I AM STILL EMPLOYED, AS I COULD HAVE A DAUGHTER GOING THROUGH UNIVERSITY. ALTHOUGH IT WOULD BE NICE TO RETIRE AT 62-63, I EXPECT I WILL NEED TO WORK UNTIL 65. I WILL NEED TO WATCH MY HEALTH AS I HAVE HAD SOME MILD BACK PROBLEMS LATELY. I MAY LOOK TO RETIRE SOMEWHERE WARM!

I live alone in a small terraced house in a state of considerable disrepair but I am past caring. I got rid of the TV when it all went digital and I must be one of the few still not on the internet. Working life came to an end as a result of public sector reforms but I put in a few hours at a charity shop for something to do. My aunts are still alive in their 90's and live in a care home about an hours drive away. I see them every month or so and struggle to look after their financial affairs. I have a fair bit of contact with a cousin living locally as we are joint trustees for his severely disabled brother. Unfortunately we have little in common and although he is a good man we don't hit it off. My diabetes, for all the medical advances in recent years gets me down, leaving me feeling tired and lethargic or irritable and anxious. I drive but prefer to walk or use public transport. I read a lot of books, amd addicted to Radio 4 and like to get up to London for art exhibitions, visits to the theatre and simply to "mooch" around. I am resigned to the solitary life although it can get very lonely at times. One of the compensations of age is that I am less worried about what other people think and I hope that this attitude will help me break down the barrriers.

I will be more musically qualified and not as fit. though I would like to increase my stamina as part of the recovery from my illness. I hope that I can have a relationship with someone I life and that I would not have to worry about a pension. If I had my life to live again I would not have cared for others but put myself first - it is only as you get older that you realise that giving is one-sided.

Life at present is in a state of such great fux and as I feel as if I can't even predict the next day or two, it seems pretty impossible to envisage 10 years hence! However, I would hope that as I will have to be employed to provide income, I will have found a degree of satisfaction / worth in whatever work I do. My husband would be fully retired and if my mum is still alive she would be 90! I would hope my children, or at least one or two of them, would be married & I look forward to time with grandchildren (although they have no inclination / intentions at the moment!) I would hope to still follow my interests, but don't know if my joints will allow me to still be playing tennis!

Whilst being in full employment I am taking advantage of still having a regular income. {WIFE} + I continue to treat ourselves to long weekends away and dining out.

Ah!! Sixty years old. I remember being fifty, writing this, as though it were only recently . . . My interests are similar to those then, but perform them with less enthusiasm and vigour. My son has left this nest to challenge his own World now, I wish him well. There is much pride in my heart though it beats at a lesser pace now. My health, I suppose is as good as to be expected, mainly due to the attention given in my youth, physically, but perhaps not in the psycologial sense. As long as I remain philosophical in my outlook my partner might suffer this fool gladly? Work appear more challenging now than then, can't wait to be done with this chore, conforming to the system becomes more tedious, as my time becomes more precious to me now.

I imagine I will still be working part time as a nurse with perhaps another small part time job as the children will (may!?) have left home. I hope to be fit enough to be able to play tennis 2 or 3 times a week and maybe have time for an evening class of bridge or join a choir. I also hope to develop some joint interests with my husband - spending more time together. I think I will be worries by a shortage of friends - especially if the children are at University. And I guess if my mother is still alive that caring for her may be a worry as I live far away from her. I am sure my friends locally will continue to offer great company friendship & support.

Observation ID: N21386D
Probably still in full time employment, assuming that my health would allow it. I expect I will still be living alone with very few friends, relatives to communicate with. I would still be 'down' most of the time as I never have been able to get rid of that feeling!

My life, work and home, is very tied with being clergy in a rural parish. I imagined that in 10 years time it might be much the same but Im hoping it might be in a more urban setting where I can walk to local amenities eg shops, swimming, library church etc. My children will be 23 & 25 & possibly out of full time education so some more disposable income for foreign travel (at 11 I remember responding that I wanted to be air hostess possibly for the same reason!) I hope that my health should be just as good & stable as now. Interests (apart from travel) might be more photography or other art related activities, incl Theatre.

Observation ID: N11919F
I enjoy my life very much. My daughter and two grandchildren mean everything to me. My partner {PARTNER} of 33 years is a lovely happy, very understanding man and we still love each other very much after all these years.

Life is so busy. I am still working at the school & throughly enjoying it. My weekly Pilates and swimming keep my body & spirits fit and sometimes I even cycle down by the canal. Planning & preparing for visits from the children and grandchildren during the holidays keeps me content, and we regularly visit family & friends. Once a fortnight I commit time to the homeless charity and still manage time for my creative art classes. Fortunately, my husband is retired so he now does much more of the household chores, giving me the time to do more interesting things. Any day now I will be having my replacement knee op - the last one lasted longer than we thought.

Observation ID: N16552Q
I am fully settled in my life, I have male friends but never remarried - I enjoy the company of men but find myself too set in my ways to share my space with a man full time. My lovely {DAUGHTER1} remains settled with round the clock care and I pick her up once a week and we walk and I feed and cuddle her and tell her how much I love her and the guilt stays. My second and middle daughter {DAUGHTER2} still has her mood swings and calls her dad all the names under the sun when really she just wants his arms around her. She doesn't seem to flinch at my touch any more, and I do what I can to help with her children - but its never enough again guilt remains and my {DAUGHTER3} - the daughter I had at 38 born into a loveless marriage, but so meant to be, at 22 I worry about the boys at the door! I like being 60 Im free, healthy and happy - And despite everything, Im blessed!!

I feel health will not be as good because my work is quite physical and is late at night so I don't get enough sleep. I expect my marriage to be still strong. Both my sons to be married and have fully left home I don't have a lot of interests except perhaps walking and watching films. I still expect to be working but hopefully not full time. I also would like to be in a different location from where I am now.

Observation ID: N27659K
Because of personal circumstances I don't want to imagine what my life would be like in 10 years time; therefore I can only write about what I can hope and aspire for. My son has become a successful doctor in the field of his choice. He has married a wonderful young lady who has become as well as a daughter-in-law a good friend. Hopefully grandchildren will arrive that I can dote on and although the family might live away, will be in regular contact and visits. My voluntary work will continue and friendships from a variety of sources grow. Pensions will be coming to fruition to enable me to perhaps take up new ventures. Hopefully my health will enable me to continue with my art and craft work, gardening and other hobbies. Being the youngest of four siblings I hope they will be around to give the support we all give to each other at the present time. Wonderful memories of 50 years and hopefully at least another 10 years!

Observation ID: N13254V
I will still have my business but will take a back seat & allow employees do 90% of the work & I will just be overseeing it.

I have made my hobby - Art - into a very successful business. It does not seem like work because it is so enjoyable. The hard work I have put into building this up since I was 50 has resulted in a substantial rise in income and with working from home, at something I love doing has allowed home life to flourish. My relationship with my wife and children couldn't be better and with more income and more time with them we really enjoy our life to the full. We have bought other property abroad and in the UK and can afford some really nice holidays without worrying financially. I have looked after my diet and fitness and feel in really good shape. I have continued to write and illustrate childrens books and enjoy teaching children how to draw cartoons. This ensures that I get about to meet people and add value to other peoples lives.

I imagine I will still be working as a nurse hopefully in the community full-time. I'll have more time on my hands to visit friends, walk, enjoy evening classes. My children would be grown up hopefully with children of their own; I'll really enjoy being a Grandma and being around if they need me. I'm guessing I will be living on my own, with a couple of dogs and chickens for company! I would be content with that. My elder son has Aspergers so he may still be living with me but I would enjoy that. My marriage at present is very rocky, with my husband taking long spells out of employment, soon I believe we will go our separate ways so by 60 I'm hoping to be divorced. It would be nice to have a partner for company - but for that's not the be all and end all. I love my job (not the politics though) love my children and my dogs. Fingers crossed I'll keep healthy - must watch my diet though!!

{SON} has just been promoted after his first year as a junior architect. We have had some tough times with him over the last 10 years, but he has pulled round and done well at University. {DAUGHTER} is doing well in her 2nd year at University - she worked hard at A-levels - well done - A* across the board. With the children rarely at home, we have decided to down size - our last major project - building a new house on the site of an old bungalow in the village. Some of the equity we have realised will help pay off the chidren's University costs. At last we can realise some of our dreams now that we have more time with each other - we are off to New Zealand for 4 weeks in December. No rest though - I am giving up my consulting business to spend more time helping {WIFE} with her business. No grandchildren in sight yet - but hopefully in the next 10 years ....

If lucky, another dead-end job on minimum wage - No disposable income so no outlets - just more debt. No pension to look forward to - Thank you Mr Brown! Social Services still refusing to pay entitled benefits - have no life savings, no redundancy payout left. Wouldn't you be suicidal? Bet all this government are sitting on their gold-plated pensions having taken early retirement - wringing their hands at how hard life is for them!

Life hasn't changed a great deal. I'm still working in a similar job but in a different organisation. I need to work until 65 in order to pay the mortgage and get some sort of reasonable pension. My interests haven't changed. I'm taking a part-time course to keep my brain active outside work. My main exersise is walking. My wife and I are still in the same house, although we expect to downsize in order to reduce household bills and release cash ready for the expected reduction in income on retirement. Our two daughters have left home and are in decent jobs. Health is still reasonable, although still have trouble getting a good night's sleep.

I hope he still manages to achieve all he does at the moment. I have been at my present employment for 20 years. Although its not challenging - I would like to think that if not there I can be healthy and lucky enough to be employed.

I am a 60 year old farmer living with my wife on the family farm, still working hard. I'm not rich but happy. Our three children have long since left home but visit us regularly with our grand children. I am still putting off having my knee replacement operation but modern farm equipment helps me cope. General health is good. Retirement is on my mind, as none of the kids were interested in farming we might as well sell up soon, which would be sad, but would allow me to pursue some of the other interests that I have such as classic cars, travel and more time for music, so far I've had no time for these. My wife and I have been married for 34 very happy years.

Today I start receiving my pension from the main job I did for 20 years but I'm still working part-time and will do so until I'm 65. My civil partner of the last 10 years and I are ok financially, probably thanks to our parents prudence over the years, and, unlike them, we have inherited and are enjoying some travel & small treats. Our health is still not bad, which is encouraging, considering the worries we had at 50 about whether we'd see 60 & probably unfounded as regards our genetic makeup but so was the point of suddenly being hit by our own mortality ! We don't have children but try to be involved with our nieces & nephews and their offspring. Hopefully, they value our contribution. Happy to be alive, to have some value still in society and, most of all, to be loved !

I have retired and so has my husband. We both do some volentary work together - maybe something environmental, and I still cook and make tea at the church. We both go to choir every week and I still play the piano, although hopefully I will have passed my grade 8 exam by then! Maybe I even teach piano to children a bit. I still go to my recorder playing group every week, but there is more chatting and coffee drinking and less playing now. We are probably not so good at it anymore. The children have finally all left home and married and bring the grandchildren to see us now and then. Mum will need looking after more if she is still alive. I am still quite healthy apart from a bit if back ache, and am leading quite an interesting life - hopefully lots of travel round the world and trips to the theater. There is a lot to fit in before I get too old to enjoy it. There is a lot to look forward to!

I am so glad we moved to the countryside a few years ago. I enjoy walking by the sea. Since we both retired a couple of years ago we have time to explore the area. We're involved in the local church and have made some good friends. The grandchildren visit often and we love taking them out. It's now nearly 15 years since I had cancer and I feel better than ever. I have more time for the garden and we also like to travel whenever possible and see new places.

I am a Director in a family business & still enjoy my work although I can now 'back off' a little & choose my own hours to work, particularly in the summer when I enjoy my golf. I have a wonderful social life & am a member at a local Golf & Country Club. I still enjoy the gym & Pilates & spinning & play Golf as often as I can. I also love to read & am a member of a local Book Club. Because I have maintaind a good level of fitness I am still able to ski during the winter & try to go at least twice during the season. I am very close to my 2 sons and have already started to teach my grandchildren to ski & play golf. I love to help out with my grandchildren & feel very priveledged to be a part of their lives. My husband is a wonderful man who shares most of my hobbies & sporting interests and we have a lot of fun together both at home and during our travels. My Parents although not as agile as they were, still enjoy good health & we are very close, as I still am to my brother & sister. I consider myself extremely fortunate!

I have recently moved into a house which I had built to my own specifications and requirements. I'm still working (self-employed) as it's been such an important part of my life, that I can't imagine not doing it, although I have other income from other projects or property. I have also been the main wage earner (sometimes the only) during my married life and feel a huge responsibility to maintain financial security (unlike my parents - both self-employed). I continue to take regular exercise, maintain my weight and enjoy a healthy and varied diet. I was diagnosed with depression some years ago, but medication works well with other lifestyle therapies. I may now still have to take medication. I can now travel more, take more holidays and be a regular theatre - goer - which I never found time for before. I hope in 10 years from now that "60 is the new 40"! P.S. And I want to still be wearing lipstick and nail varnish!!

By the time I am 60yrs of age I would like to still be happily married and healthy enough to enjoy my children and grandchildren, I would like to think that I could do some voluntary work, either helping the elderly or in some capacity with animals.

Observation ID: N16449S
OK, so I'm now sixty! Assuming lady luck stays with me and I stay safe I hope to be pretty much in the same position as I am now, namely at fifty I'm happily married, healthy, free of debt, reasonably free of stress and worry, in a position to work when I want to then drop it to concentrate on my other interests when that suits me, etc etc. I can't see how I can't achieve this. Nevertheless I am concerned for the future. Global warming really scares me, as does the risk of terrorist outrage and it's consequences which could wipe out all the financial assetts we've accumulated. As an only child with aging parents I'm concerned about them too, and what I might have to do to support them. I also fear for the future and what it will bring for our two daughters who, educationally, should be capable of persuing a good career, but in what sort of world? I despise George Bush and his legacy.@However I want to remain as optimistic as I can. I'll continue, of course, The Across Wales Walk through which I've achieved things very important to me, namely the long-standing friendship and appreciation of many fine people, something vastly so important than £s to me. Living life to the full at sixty for me is not waiting until retirement by which time, well, who knows? PERSONAL ...and still both pleased and proud to be part of the NCDS...and with apologies for the spelling which, over fifty years, I've still not got right!

hopefully by the time I reach 60 years old, we will have carried out all of the upgrading on our home as we have planned, and will be settled and secure. As {HUSBAND} is older, we will be retired. I would like to think I will be fit and active enough to enjoy holidays in the UK and abroad, and to 'potter' around in the garden, and in the kitchen. I plan to have more time for pastel painting and craft and to spend some time working with {HUSBAND} on the landscape/scenery for his model train layout which will be in a downstairs room by then (and not in the loft!) We shouldn't have the responsibility for looking after his mother by then - she is 84 now. If my parents are still around, and they would then be in their 80's, we would have to have help, as at 60 I don't expect to be able to physically, or mentally take the strain we do currently. My son may be married by then, but hopefully still live nearby as he does now.

Observation ID: N11061E
I will probably still be doing crosswords and puzzles, I like to sew on the machine I presume me and my husband will have more free time together, I have problems with my back and knee, which I can see getting worse with age: this will make things like walking more difficult. I am not working due to my back problems, although I did do voluntary work for about ten years prior to this. I dont think I will be working in 10 years time (apart from housework!)

Observation ID: N14246Z
At 60 I will still be working part-time. My husband will almost be retired from full time work. Our 3 children will be married and we will probably be Grandparents My parents will be in their late 80's and maybe need help at home I will have more time to be at home and spend more time with friends. I will be just as involved with Church helping wherever I am needed. I hope to be in good health and looking forward to retirement from paid work.

We have less animals now & the children live fairly locally. We have more time for travel both in this Country & abroad. We are thinking of moving to a smaller (but not too small!) house. We need space though for grandchildren to stay. We are in pretty good health. I still play the flute at church & attend bible study.

If the above happens I'll have more time to play golf, go fishing with friends and enjoy the garden; I'd also hope to be fit enough to ski for a couple of weeks per year. At home I suspect we will have a number of grandchildren to add to those we already have in NZ & Australia.

Being 60 years old and retired is much better than spending a life as a P.E. teacher working in an enviroment where the management possess few morals and set few standards for one to admire. I feel I have earned my retirement. I am living abroad for a number of months throughout the year. I regret not finding a partner early in life and having children. Meeting the right person at the right time did elude me and I felt let down by certain individuals during my life. But I had determination to succeed instilled through my close relationship with my mother. At work / professional life was influenced by other individuals. I succeeded most by doing things on my own and my determination to be successful!

Sometimes I worry about paying the mortgage off but I try not to let this take over my thoughts because I'm sure all will be well in the end. I am still basically a positive person.

I still work part time (three days a week). I do gardening regularly & walk sometimes but not as often as I did when my husband was younger. I love reading & spend lots of time doing just that. I'm getting a bit stiffer in the joints now & don't feel that I have the energy quite as much as I had ten years ago. I am beginning to look forward to retirement in five years time. As a dispensing optician for the last forty years I have seen lots of changes in optics & not all for the better. I feel more settled now then I did when we first moved to Scotland, more at home & one of the locals now. I still feel, sometimes, that I would like to move back south & may very well when anything happens to my husband, providing I out-live him of course!! The only trouble with that is all my friends have either moved or passed away so it probably won't be the same now as it was I will just have to wait & see.

At 60 years old I hope to be retired from work and spending a lot more time with my family. Going for walking holidays in the countryside with my husband. I hope I will have good health although I have painful hips at present so we'll see. I feel I will have to do some kind of voluntary work to fill in some of my spare time and give something back to the community, it would have to be working with people who for some reason require assistance. I really enjoy helping people.

Observation ID: N15982E
I hope that when I am 60 I will still be doing the kind of work I am doing now, but at a higher management level and with a shorter round trip to work. I may have another child as I have recently re-married. I hope my health will still be fine and that I can pursue most activities and hobbies I have now, cycling and walking mainly.

Since reaching 50 I have found myself feeling very loved and settled. I got married in July 2005 with a lot of hope for the future my husband {HUSBAND} had 2 heart attacks in 2004 and it was a very worrying time but we came through it together. I work in a school kitchen it is very hard work but I enjoy it. When I return home I look after {HUSBAND} he only works parttime now. I have a little dog called {DOG}. She is 4 we take her for walks and most weekends in the summer we go to our caravan. In my spare time I like to walk, read and for about 10 years I have done THI CHI which I have found very good for me.

I'm lucky enough to be able to play squash and badminton regularly and continue to meet friends at various pubs and bars occasionally. Having paid off my mortgage a few years ago, I'm financially more secure than ever, and beginning to think about my impending retirement in more detail. I probably have a few more aches and pains than I am used to, but not as many as some of similar age due to my continued interest in sport & keeping fit. I'm likely to remain in full-time employment for 5 more years but I may have the option of going part-time if I decide it suits me. As ever, I have some very good female friends but no-one 'special', as this suits my lifestyle.

I am still with the same wife and still working, albeit the work has changed in order to reduce the amount of travelling. My health is satisfactory and I am still able to participate in physical activities, such as: sport, walking, diy and gardening, as is my wife. We have similar interests to those we have enjoyed for many years. The mortgage is paid, which reduces financial pressure and the need to try to sustain the same level of income. I expect to work unitl 65 as we have only modest pension provision despite contributing throughout our working lives. I am frustrated by the absence of communities and the increased isolation of people and families within their homes, their refuge, where they seem to look inwards and ignore the wider 'family' that is the social network we inhabit. This isolation is worrying as we grow older.

I have worked for many years as a part-time teacher of adults who wish to learn English (either as a second language or who wish to improve their literacy skills). This has allowed me to spend time with my daughters as they grow up, whilst at the same time providing an interesting job and good income. When I finally got into a regular working pattern in a job that paid reasonably well, I was able to spend some leisure time doing things I wanted to do, instead of being pre-occupied with my family or work, so now I am able to go swimming or play tennis, to go to museums, galleries, the theatre or cinema and to take up pastimes such as studying French, learning about art, learning the guitar - things I have never had the time for before. I know my girls are in good jobs and good relationships - they are happy and so am I.

So here I am at 60 still driving my beloved sports car. My back is a little stiffer and getting in and out sometimes a problem but I think I am in better condition than the car. My husband is now 78 and I have been at home looking after him since I retired 5 years ago. Most of the interests I have revolve around the home and looking after all my exotic pets,. I have just started an Art Foundation Course, Something I wanted to do 42 years ago but my parents told me I had to get a proper job. Funny how I eventually ended up teaching art! The children still live at home and are still saving up for their own places. Their company keeps us young and all their friends poping in is a pleasure. I'm still trying to get used to wearing glasses and use my dyslexia as an excuse when the writing is too small to see. I probably need a hearing aid, thats next on my list of things to do.

I remember writing an essay aged 11, on how I expected my life to be when I was 21, and, imagined I would work at a teacher. I was wrong then, so could easily be again. At 60, I don't expect to have embarked on retirement, partly because, with 2 children who will be 21 and 24, I will probably be still financially in need and partly because I would be bored if I reduced my working hours. I hope to still be writing, to have moved away from London, to be living in a smaller (less expensive) house, and to enjoy more cultural and other leisure events. I hope to have enjoyed success with my books and to have more time and money for travelling, theatre trips and so on. I hope my children will visit and stay regularly and will be happy in their chosen paths. I would like to remain active (swimming, walking and playing tennis) and hope my back problems are kept at bay. I would like finally to have achieved my dream of living near the sea.

I hope that at 60 years I will still be fit and well enough to be doing my hobbies, such as horse riding, Pilates/Yoga, Latin dance exercises and walking.

My husband will be 71 by then and I hope he too will be well and still with me and that we will be enjoying a full life in retirement. Also, I hope the Stock Market recovers enough to provide us with a liveable pension!

At the age of 60, I am still employed in Childcare & education. I am happily married with 4 settled daughters and a number of grandchildren with whom I spend a lot of my spare time. Unfortunately, I still have a mortgage and little spare cash with which I can enjoy a few holidays a year. I am still a regular member of {LOCAL} Church where I am still involved in a number of groups. I still haven't learnt to drive and so walk regularly. Apart from the odd aches and pains, I am in good health and enjoy going for walks, going to the theatre and socialising with friends. Sadly some people whom I love dearly are no longer with us or are suffering with deteriorating health.

I imagine myself to be still working as a teacher, probably part-time, although thinking about retirement in the next few years. I would like to still be playing as much sport as I do, health permitting, and without so many commitments to children/parents, travel more. I imagine my children will have left home and will be living not too far away. If my parents are still living, I imagine they will be in some kind of care home, quite local to me. I imagine my husband & I would be thinking about possibly moving house, to downsize, although family circumstances would dictate this.

Observation ID: N25856E
I'm still teaching part-time, though it is more difficult to keep up with the changes though most lead to things I've done 20 years ago. The guitar playing is still going, though the fingers aren't as nimble as they used to be. I miss not playing football, though the occasional gentle game of badminton is fun. The grandchildren are a delight and give a focus for the future and the tablets continue to keep the blood pressure under control.

Observation ID: N12035G
I am living near the coast with my husband who has now retired too. My garden is medium-sized but full of form and flowers, perhaps a small veg patch.

Our health is good, we are at peace with our life, and our love has endured. I am settled

Perhaps have another dog, only this time from a puppy, going on a lot more holidays in our caravan, if the state of the nation has picked up again. Also I would like to imagine that we have finished all the works on our bungalow. But most of all I want my children to be settled & happy. It would be nice to have Grand-children.

Observation ID: N26407M
I imagine that my husband will be retired and perhaps doing some voluntary work. If not already done so, my son will be leaving home and/or we will be helping him set up in a flat. I will be working still as my husband has virtually no pension. I enjoy my garden and running and hope that these activities will help me stay healthy. I hope that we will have sufficient income to have holidays abroad - there are still some countires I'd like to visit.

Observation ID: N22674N
I enjoy my life at 60. At 50 times were emotionally difficult since my husband left me for another woman. The trauma to me and my family was unbearable. At 60 my life has changed. I am secure again. The house is now in my name. I cope so much better and enjoy my life. I still work as a Practice Nurse and enjoy all the challenges in a job that has brought me so much satisfaction. I enjoy running still and have very good health. I love the theatre and socialising with my friends. My faith and church are a huge part of my life and much of what I do and who I am revolves around that. My relationship with my son & daughter is good and settled. Most of all I am at peace as the hate & bitterness & betrayal of my husband leaving has now eased.

I'm in reasonably good health, especially since I now finally have the time to indulge my interests of walking and swimming on a regular basis. However I am constantly worried about the health of my partner and regretful that he is rarely able to share my interests due to his weight & diabetes. I am continuing to persue other interests such as piano, singing, voluntary work etc. My children have all grown up, married and begun to have children of their own, so my husband and I grab every opportunity to visit them, or help care for the grandchildren. My husband has now retired but I intend to work until at least 65. We are financially secure enough to enjoy some more foreign holidays! We see our friends more often now that our family commitments have eased.

I have just returned home from my round the world trip - my sole amibition in life was to be a 'grown up back-packer', having missed that opportunity as a teenager. I am now settling back into work. My health is good and to improve it I have joined the local health club; I am able to do this now as there is more money available now that my daughter has left home and the mortgage is repaid. For a few hours a week I am able to do volunteer work, something I have not done since my twenties - this gives me the feeling I am contributing. I feel much happier now there is less money worries and more to spend on myself. Generally life is good!

I imagine that I will still be working part-time but retirement will be in sight and I look forward to travelling a lot more with my husband then. I don't imagine I'll still be looking after my mother so I shall have more time. I hope I'll be socialising a lot with friends, either going out to dinner or cinema trips as we do now. I expect the children will be in steady relationships - if not married - but can't see me being a grandmother by then. I hope they'll still enjoy coming home for the odd w/end and perhaps still the occasional ski-trip. That would all presume we're fit and well so those gym visits will have to continue for the time being.

I would hope to be living in a small house/cottage (with my wife) in a village in the North of England. We would hopefully not have a mortgage. The house would have some land and we would grow most of our own vegetables. We would go walking a good deal. I would still expect to be working but preferably not 40 hours a week for virtually the whole year. We would still travel around Europe - a couple of trips per year. Relatives and friends would come to visit/stay and we would visit them in turn.

Observation ID: N13685Q
Sadly, I expect my parents will most likely have passed away during the next ten years. As I still live with them (and rely to some extent on them for my financial security at present) this will mean a vast change in my way of life. I expect I will have to sell the house in which we live and find a more suitable house for a single man. I will probably take the opportunity for a change in job. All this presupposes that I survive for ten years myself! If I suffer a significant personal health scare, I may well have been forced into a rather different lifestyle altogether.

I also hope that I can have a little more time in the Garden and DIY, all beit maybe I will be a little slower and possibly rest in the evening instead of racing about being a mun's taxi.

I'd like to think that I would still be in good health and enjoying my part-time job. My eldest should by now have left home and my youngest should be at University. With less family responsibilites I would hope that my husband and I can have more quality time together, finding new things to do in preparation for our retirement.

I may have retired from teaching, but may still be maintaining my interest in modern languages by having my own classes for pre-school children. I will hopefully continue to visit new places around the world with my husband. I hope my blood pressure issues continue to be under control allowing me to lead a fulfilling life. My sons are all happy hopefully and in jobs they enjoy - we may even have some grandchildren! I will continue going to the gym and swimming and would like to continue learning Latin-American dances. I will continue to enjoy reading and planning new DIY projects for our home. I would like to have a holiday home in Italy or Spain.

I IMAGINED MY MIND WOULD BE AS GOOD AS MY BODY, BUT IT IS NOT. MY MIND FEELS LIKE I AM STILL IN MY UNCLEAR, BUT WITH MORE WISDOM. I STILL AM VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH MY WIFE OF 31 YEARS. MY SON IS ALL GROWN UP, BUT IMPORTANTLY HE VISITS WITH HIS WIFE & CHILD. I CONTINUE TO BE A VRAY ACTIVE CHRISTIAN. READING RATHER THAN WATCHING T.V. IS WHAT I DO MOST EVENINGS. MY HEALTH HAS DETERIORATED, TO THE POINT OF NOT BEING ABLE TO BE PYHSICALLY ACTIVE. ONE THINK I DO REALIZE IS THAT HAVE FEWER YEARS AHEAD THAN BEHIND. OVERALL I LOOK BACK WITH FEW REGRETS, THE ONES I HAVE, I WILL ALWAYS HAVE.

Observation ID: N11924C
Continue to swim possibly more frequently as not working full time anymore. Walking frequently and taking holidays abroad, sailing.

Financially comfortable with a small disposable income to allow eating out and entertaining friends on a regular basis. Would be part of 'club' - dancing/sports. With partner to regular meetings. Happy and healthy. Working part time maybe on voluntary basis or reduced hours in current position.

Observation ID: N13614Z

Observation ID: N15409E
I am pleased to say that I still enjoy keeping fit, about two or three times a week, which certainly give me a focus. Life is certainly different without the boys at home but we still keep in touch regularly and it's great to see them on a monthly basis. My wife and I tend to make a point of getting to see a show or a film and eating out regularly. The opportunity to holiday outside of the main holidays gives us much more scope now, and there are certainly less crowds. I still enjoy working on a part time basis and am seriously considering getting involved in some voluntary work.

On my 60th year on this Earth, I would hope to be nearing retirement from my career as a nurse and looking forward to spending some time and money travelling to other Countries on holidays. I hope to be fairly healthy with a good physical and emotional well being. I will spend much more time with my family and friends: I have my own home in a lovely Market Town with lots of friends and family around me. I would perhaps live on my own, and have more time to invite people round for social evenings. I would plan to do some work, involving helping others as that has been my career. Hobbies, some art and some form of exercise to keep fit and young!

I AM 60 YEARS OLD, IN GOOD HEALTH AND HAVE A JOB I ENJOY. I HAVE MANY INTERESTS IN MY SPARE TIME, SO WHEN I CHOOSE TO RETIRE I WILL HAVE MANY THINGS TO KEEP ME BUSY. 10 YEARS AGO I STARTED BUILDING AND UP GRADING COMPUTERS SAVING A FORTUNE ON REPAIR BILLS. BEING A QUALIFIED TOOLMAKER ENABLES ME TO MAKE THINGS USING HAND TOOLS AND UNDERSTAND INSTRUCTIONS, SO MOST THINGS BECOME QUITE EASY TO DO ONCE YOU READ THE INSTRUCTIONS. I STILL ENJOY MOST SPORTS. I STILL GO TO LORDS AND THE OVAL TO WATCH TEST CRICKET. I ALSO STILL GO TO CRYSTAL PALACE TO WATCH AND TAKE PICTURES USING ONE OF MY MANY CAMERAS. I WILL KEEP WORKING BEYOND RETIREMENT AGE IF POSSIBLE. TOO MANY OF MY WORKMATES DIE WITHIN 2 YEARS OF STOPPING WORK WITH NO INTERESTS TO KEEP THE MIND ACTIVE. I WILL NOT BE ANOTHER ONE.

I had enough money to retire at 58 and, with my mortgage paid and lower expenses (eg work attire, travel costs etc) I consider myself financially secure. I have also invested my lump sum on retirement in a property in {COUNTRY Europe}, so I divide my time between London and Cumbria. While in London I do some supply teaching or other work on a part time basis to supplement my income, and in {COUNTRY} I spend my time either writing my semi-autobiographical novel or leading groupos of British or American tourists on historical visits. I've maintained my romantic relationship in {COUNTRY}, which is fulfilling and very happiness-inducing. I have a wide circle of friends both in London and {COUNTRY}. My health is excellent as always. I believe strongly in keeping both my body and brain active, so I have a number of pursuits which I regularly engage in.

Negative version: I will still have constant pain in my neck & shoulders I will still be lonely but making the best of it (as now) I will be fat and have diabetes or some other condition relating to my stomach or blood sugar. My lower back problem will get worse. I will not feel accepted or valued in this market town (or another I have moved to) to start afresh i.e. my plans will not work out.

I expect I'll still be working when I'm 60, but it would be nice to work part-time, so I have more time for writing my novel. Perhaps I'd be cataloguing in a library, or halping to organise digital material if physical libraries are obsolete. But then again, I might be trying to finish a PhD in literature & have abandoned libraries to teach students & write articles, who knows? I expect I'd still be going to science fiction conventions to meet up with my Friends who would probably still be bemoaning the fact that not enough new young fans are sharing our interest in fanzines & old SF books. I hope I would still be living with [partner], though we might have moved away from [county] - We'd like to live in Europe, but that probably won't happen as [partner] doesn't speak any foreign languages - But maybe we'll be living in Scotland and doing some travelling - I'd like to think I'd still be fit and well, and able to go and explore Latin America or other parts of the world (if international travel is still feasible for ordinary people!)

We now have Grandchildren and spend as much time as possible visiting them. My time is taken up working but I hope to retire in my early 60's.

I am still happily married & we're both in good health - our children have now left home & we have time for ourselves & doing what we want. Both families live locally so we're able to spend plenty time with them & also grandchildren. I've stopped working & look after the grandchildren for part of the week to reduce child-care costs. I also attend a patchwork class & go swimming during the week. My husband now only works part time so this lets us take our holidays throught the year, avoiding school holidays which is a novelty for us. We both still have our interest in the theatre & enjoy our outings there. Although we enjoy each others company it's nice to have the whole family together at every opportunity, although it can be tiring.

Ideally I would like to be retired by 60 but cannot realistically see this as my partner of 8 yrs & I are desperate to move house to a larger property and of course this means and increased mortgage. I would still love to be playing my favourite sport, tennis & taking part in other activities such as keep fit classes, maybe golf as I used to play a while ago. Maybe by then I may need a knee replacement as I have already had an arthroscopy which showed I have very little cartilage left. Although my knee is painful at times I am not going to let it get the better of me as far as possible - maybe a new knee will give me a new lease of life beyond 60! If I were able to retire I would most definitely do voluntary work of some sort, perhaps driving people to hospital appointments, meals on wheels, focus on the elderly before I get to old myself.

As I have a terminal illness, I am highly unlikely to reach 60 years of age! However, before this diagnosis, my plan was to be retired, living in Spain with my husband, enjoying a relaxed lifestyle in the sun. We intended to explore the area, set up home, learn Spanish in order to fully intergrate into the local community.

I hope my health will be good and I will still be working, unless I have won the lottery!

In my dreams at sixty, I would like to have enough money to not have to work full time. A part time job or voluntary work would keep my mind and body active! A move to a cottage in the country would be ideal. I would have more time to spend with my family and hopefully would have several grandchildren to spoil, and at least 2 holidays a year to look forward to. In reality, I don't see my life changing too much in the next 10 years. Hopefully, I will not be working in such a demanding job. With any luck the grandchildren will arrive and as long as I have my health, family & friends, then I'll be happy! However, I'm always looking for new challenges - so who knows ?!

I would have liked to have retired at 60 as I always expected to in my working life but will no longer be able to (due to government changes). When I do retire I would like to move to a home easier to maintain. I always have animals around me as long as I am fit enough to look after them properly, they are my main source of happiness and reason for living (and reason for exercise). I will continue to see friends and my daughter. I will continue to enjoy my garden, reading etc. I will no doubt be exhausted at work (if still in the same type of employment as it is quite physical). I will continue to be on a low wage and then even less on a pension. So a mixture of good and bad things I envisualise for my future.

I will continue to attend church as this is important to me. I would like to move to a house with a larger garden in order to grow fruit & vegetables and become more self sufficient.

We now have several grandchildren. I am now working a few hours a week to keep some money coming in but I'll possibly be looking to retire in the near future. I am sure I will continue with some sort of voluntary work for as long as I can. My Christian Faith is very important to me & this influences much of my life, both with church & other voluntary activities. My faith also helps me to cope with problems in life as I feel supported by prayer & practical support from my friends & family. I still play my bass guitar although I wonder how many more years I can continue with this (a grey haired lady playing bass!). I still enjoy my weekly exercise class which also helps to keep my weight down! We still enjoy our caravan holidays taken in this beautiful country.

I want to take a sort of Sabattical for a year to allow myself to really discern what direction I now go in.....and I would like that decision to be one not driven by financial considerations.

I am not as driven as I used to be and feel I am getting the balance right more often and therefore not getting as angry at people and events. The health scares have receded and I am not as obsessive about food and exercise. I would like to get more involved with the parish and still value the community and Parish priest there enormously.

We live a simple, slow life in {PLACE South West England}. There are less demands on our time from elderly relatives. I either don't work or work less hours to top up our income (for a small local business) We both have the time at last to persue our creative interest (mine - exploring textiles & pottery and colour), to walk and read. We enjoy our local environment & culture and the company of each other and friends. We are both fairly fit & healthy, we walk and use public transport (we have not had a car now for 15 years) + not flown for 22. We do not have much money but do not need much as our tastes are simple - we grow a lot of our own food, cook from basics, supply some of our own electricity, use a compost toilet and have simple tastes in entertainment A lot of this we have done for years but have evolved it further over the last decade. The sense of always rushing has gone PS Me + {HUSBAND} = We

What I would like is for myself & my husband to be financially able to have a couple of holidays a year (on our own!) & to be able to go out for meals etc a couple of times a month.

Observation ID: N17920Y
hopefully I will have 'retired', but working 50-60 hours per week over the last 25 years have taken their toll, and health is poor. the dream of a quiet life is still almost unobtainable, the pressure of having 3 children of my own & 2 step-children & all the troubles & worries that brings means that there is NO time for 'us'. Retirement brings the chance for reflection, however. A Busy & challenging job does leave you with memories & experiences that mould what remains of your life. I work in a basic non challenging job, with little stress OR worry - part time & still allowing contact with the human Race. My personal relationship is good & strong but doubt & fears caused by the death of my first wife (2003) are still with me. overall I am happy but wish this happiness had come earlier in my wife.

I stopped working a few years ago when my husband retired and now just do a few days supply teaching to keep in contact with old friends. I spend most of my time working towards self sufficiency in the kitchen and garden. I have enlarged my flock of chickens since I retired and neighbours are happy to buy my surplus eggs. My vegetable and fruit plots have expanded too and I have started experimenting with freezing/pickling/preserving excess produce to use later in the year. I find that gardening is relaxing and good exercise and more importantly gets me out in the fresh air. The only conflict in my life is that my husband wants to spend months away travelling and I don't like to leave my family and garden for that long!

Observation ID: N11145H
I am happy with my lot. I continue to be involved in performing music, photography and walking. My home life is good - we have a nice house, kids at university and time to share with each other.

By this time I expect to be working a 40 hr week in an office environment on a low income trying to make ends meet with little chance of improving my circumstances due to my age and competition in the job market. If I had a job as a SAP inputter/technical clerk working in the aircraft industry that would suit me fine but then again I can't be too fussy at my age. I would want to retire by 65. My children 14 & 12 would be settled in at the local state school (or private if I could afford it) in the hope that they have long and fulfilling lives. We would live in a 3 bed house in Fishponds or somewhere near where good local facilities exist in a virtually crime and drug free environment. I expect to stay in my relationship with my long term partner but as I already realise nothing can be taken for granted in relationships. Hopefully my health is no worse than it was in 2008 and I would like to be free of stress and family problems. Finally, it given the time I would like to continue with my archaological project work and transport campaigning.

Observation ID: N12485E
I MAY STILL BE WORKING IN THE SAME JOB AND I HOPE TO SEE SOME FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN THOSE TEN YEARS.

THE CHILDREN WILL ALL BE INDEPENDANT AND WORKING. SOME OF THEM WILL BE MARRIED AND WE WILL HAVE A FEW GRANDCHILDREN. MY WIFE AND I WILL HAVE MORE TIME TO OURSELVES, ALTHOUGH IF THE CHILDREN LIVE NEARBY, WE WOULD LOOK AFTER THE GRANDCHILDREN FROM TIME TO TIME. SOME OF OUR PARENTS MAY HAVE DIED DURING THIS PERIOD, BUT SOME OF OUR TIME MAY BE SPENT IN CARING FOR THOSE WHO SURVIVE INTO THEIR 90s.

Observation ID: N27571C
I will be working - hopefully something different to now, maybe at a higher level (not definately) Childrens social care. living in same place as now.

Observation ID: N19146S
Health - my physical health might improve as I am due to have a knee operation in a few weeks to repair damaged cartilage. This might enable me to take up tennis and dancing again. Homelife - Our children will have left home, this will enable my husband & I to have more time for shared interests, outings etc. and a fuller social life. I hope we may be able to have some weekends away together for fell-walking. Work - I am currently in my first year as a member of the Clergy in the Church of England. I am working part time on a voluntary basis at the moment. I imagine that in 10 years time I will be working more hours per week and in a paid position, possibly in Chaplaincy work.

AT THE MOMENT, I THINK IT WILL BE VERY UNLIKELY THAT I WILL BE RETIRED AT 60! I DO HAVE PLANS TO GRADUALLY CHANGE MY CAREER SO THAT I WILL HAVE MORE 'FREE' TIME TO FOLLOW OTHER INTERESTS. IN RECENT YEARS, AS A FAMILY, WE HAVE BECOME INTERESTED IN SAILING, AND I NOW HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH A CHARITY WHICH WORKS WITH YOUNG PEOPLE INVOLVING SAILING. AS AN ACTIVE SPORTS PERSON, I TAKE PART IN DISTANCE RUNNING & TRIATHLON AND INTEND TO STILL BE COMPETING IN 10 YEARS - HOPEFULLY BASKING IN THE GLORY OF BEATING 3HRS 30 FOR A MARATHON. OBVIOUSLY I AM HOPING TO REMAIN AS HEALTHY AS I AM NOW - I CERTAINLY DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL CHANGE. OUR CHILDREN SHOULD HAVE LEFT HOME!

My marriage will still be as strong as ever: The future is of concern with old age I believe I will feel more vunrable to attacks From yobs etc. and going out at night will be a No, No. Hopefully the Financial Investments I have made in the past will be bringing Support to enable us to enjoy our lives with out having to be too prudent.

I am working as a teacher, and doing social work with an agency few hours per week as I need the money. I doubt have a pension as I have not been able to earn enough money per week/month to live let alone putting funds into pension plan so I will unfortunately have to work until my time ends - I am not able to work more than a few hours per week 16hrs? maybe due to disability which has been progressive since the age of 40ish I do enjoy my work and it is very important to me, my incapacity benefit stopped at 60 so financially living is very difficult. I have many hobbies which are very important, painting, creative needlework but do not get much time as am tired after work and in increased pain. Grandchildren very important to me.

After receiving voluntary redundancy, followed by early retirement 10 years ago my husband & I decided to move from S England to N Scotland, where my mother was from, & where we've spent a lot of time over the years. We have no children, or parents still alive so decided to take the plunge whilst we were still young enough to enjoy ourselves (my husband is 12 years older than me). I'm still finding information to add to my family tree & we've had some good trips away to various parts of Britain, researching at record offices, I can now put together lots of background information about our ancestors, which I have been researching for years. I'm still "hooked" on my Scottish dancing, but unfortunately the knees don't let me do very elegant steps, but we do have some great laughs, & as I puff after a particularly lively dance it must be keeping me fit! My memory has never been good but hope that trying to learn so many dances helps me to keep my brain sharp. Fortunately, as we're in our occupational pensions, & only do the odd bit of voluntary work - like helping the Highland Family History Society with their graveyard transcription project.

Observation ID: N13472D

I am enormously enjoying being able to spend more time with him either in London going to UNCLEAR & concerts, UNCLEAR off to UNCLEAR & at last having a few holidays. Now I don't have such a menagerie of animals it frees me up a lot. My garden design business fits in well with this as I can fit it in around my life, rather as my hands on gardening did when the children were small. {HUSBAND} is conducting music so we are busy arranging concerts for him. I suppose his daughters may well be married & have children by now, so I expect we may be required for some babysitting duties. My own garden is finally more mature & we are about to extend the house which will make a huge difference.

I have recently lost my job, end of contract after a year's immense learning and hard labour. I am not as physically fit as would like to be and have limitations now to the tasks I can do. I still enjoy craft work but limited to what I can now do in the garden, and this is a big miss. I still enjoy spending time with my grand-daughter, swimming not as able as used to. I love being in my family's company thats when I feel relaxed, and loved and needed. I struggle to get employment as suffering from stress creates so many anxieties travelling sleeping and holding on to a post, which is easier in a calm environment. I'm no longer equiped to work in the fast lane and I get scared of under performing as employers compare inefficiency and seek younger employees to fulfill the shortfall I now leave. My inadequacy increases making me feel utterly useless, and more dependant on those around to support my now everyday needs. Future is grim with little to look forward to.

At 60 my life will be very similar to now. Although my children will have left home and my husband will have retired from his career, my day to day life will still revolve round the house and garden. I may have grandchildren by this time so I will be able to help out with their childcare. My priorities have always been home and family and I can't see that this will change in the next 10 years. I do fear that my joint pain will become more of a hinderance, but will continue to stay as active as I can.

PERSONAL@Interests My main focus continues to be the family although, with {SON1} hoping to go to University in October, only {WIFE} and I will actually be living at No32. I still enjoy watching sport and continue to follow {LOCAL TEAM} with my pals for college days. I'm rather less closely involved with the local cricket, rugby and football clubs now that the boys are that much more grown up. I'm still an avid reader and enjoy all types of fiction and other material which satisfies my continuing interest in the world around me. Home Life {WIFE} and I expect to move to a smaller property later in the year assuming that {SON1} is successful in being accepted at college. {SON2} is in his second year of reading Architecture at the {UNIVERSITY}. We are currently considering the merits of relocating to {PLACE1 South West England} but leaving {PLACE2 South West England} would be very difficult for all of us. Like myself, {WIFE} currently works from home on a part-time basis. Health & Well-Being I'm still just about managing to keep my BMI below the Obese limit. I'm afraid that I enjoy my beer and cheese too much to manage much more. With less time spent running the boys around these days at least I have more time for myself which I like to use, in part, by getting involved with the U3A Walking Group. I'm also still playing the occasional game of golf, tennis and squash. I'm conscious of my memory getting progressively more unreliable and I fear that I may end up suffering from some form of dementia like Dad. However, mainly through being in full control of my daily routine, I continue to take a great deal of pleasure from life and I'd like to think that most people see me as being a cheery positive type of chap. Work Although I do the odd bit of book-keeping and market research to help keep the wolf from the door, most of my work is done on a voluntary basis these days. I'm still on the parish magazine, Marlborough Jazz Festival and cricket club committees. I also serve as Treasurer of a national Aperger's Syndrome charity. PERSONAL

With teenage children, I imagine I will still be trying to find IT contracting work (hoping ageism doesn't inhibit this). My interests will still be watching and participating in sport, hopefully watching my children compete at football, tennis or whatever sports they enjoy. I am hoping my good health continues and I am able to keep up my running (perhaps participating in the great north run and completing the half marathon in under 2 hours) I suspect my other great interests of science and philosopy will still be taking a back seat as I ferry my children from one event to another. Hopefully they will be interested in my passion for genealogy. My mental state will be influenced largely but the health and well-being of my children. Having a 2 year old daughter diagnosed with cancer this year my greatest wish is that she and her brothers are in good health when I am 60.

At 60 (if Country is properly Governed!) I will have better health as my medical conditions have been treated instead of ineffectively medicated! This has enabled me to work part-time in the community utilizing qualifications I already have. My husband & I spend our leisure time walking our dogs with our grandchid (ren) and tending our vegetable patch. We have plenty of quality TV to watch as 'reality' programs were consigned to the scrap-heap 9 years ago. Our children all live in quality affordable homes, built by people taken off benefits and given a living wage. They have easy access to services thank to taxes being spent on the service they were meant for. There are good roads being laid across the country by thos who's previous employment includes M.P's of all parties, and financiers who caused a meltdown in the markets. However if the status-quo remains the same, at 60 I'll be dead.

I still practise yoga as I feel it is important to keep active but general wear and tear mean I'm not as good at it as I would like to be!

It's great being retired! I never have a minute - so many friends to meet up & go out for lunch with. I can now go on holiday during term time - cheaper prices at last! I'm ready for my bed at the end of the day, with my busy life. At least when my morgage ends I'll have a bit more money to spend on me. I've got time to cook & experiment with new recipes My diet is much healthier as I've got more time to buy fresh food & time to cook proper meals instead of rushing in & being too tired to bother & then eating conveniently! Glad I've not gone grey! Have to go now - I'm due at the bowling club with my sister - they've roped me into the team now. It's a family affair!

Observation ID: N23214S
A more relaxed attitude to life these days - too bad it takes one to get to 60 before feeling it doesn't really matter what other people think! Now with children through university and two of the three working abroad, life is quieter on the home front but I can now enjoy fulfilling and useful work in the community, now that some financial pressures are off I now take a more direct, conscious approach to looking after my health, and try to get to at least one exercise class a week. Enjoy expanding my knowledge in holistic Therapies and have taken advantage of my 'recycled teenager' status to enrol on one or two courses. Happy enough!

Observation ID: N19132L
I hope I have good health and also have a reasonable enough pension to be able to go out socially & follow the things I want to do.

Just the same as now, if not worse due to my disability. Not being able to get around (outside all the time) means life is always going to have limits. Will be depending on other people all the time.

I would hope to be living in a smaller town on the edge of {PLACE1 South West England} and joining in local societies and activities. I would hope to be less stressed as the 4 children will be through university. I see myself as having done a Phd in history (which I am applying for) and either volunteering or working part time. I will need the social contact. After 25 years of bringing up kids I would hope me & my husband would be healthy and able to enjoy our free time. My husband is hoping to retire by 60, I hope the children will not be too far away and that we are grandparents. I would hope that we could travel more. With the children leaving home & no longer part of {PLACE1} schools I am beginning to fee isolated where I live now so the main thing at 60 would be that we have successfully moved to {PLACE2 South East England} and are enjoying life there & having grandchildren to stay regularly.

But for the purposes of this exercise I expect my health to be worse, I don't expect to be in a partnership and certainly not a marriage. I expect that I will have to continue to be employed in order to survive financially. My interests will be similar - art, exhibitions, similar, visiting cities and buildings of interest, possibly taking some adult learning classes.

I think when I am 60 life would be very similar to now. I do not intend to stop working as I really enjoy my job and since I reguarly play sport and ride my horse I cannot see anything drastically changing.

My husband and I have finished full-time work, we have moved to a smaller house and only have to cover everyday expenses from our income (which includes pensions). I'm very pleased that I had a chance to do further study and now use this expertise in ad hoc consultancy and advisory work. My husband has also been able to follow his interests with more spare time and less stress from demanding work. I'm also pleased that my efforts to get healthier in my fifties mean that I can still be fairly active. We enjoy walking in the countryside and cycling. At last our children are independent and building a good life for themselves - I'm hopeful that their partnerships will make them happy and bring us grandchildren. Some of our time is taken up with caring for our parents who are elderly but not ill or unable to enjoy life. I also have some time to contribute to a local community organisation in a voluntary capacity. We do not have the wealth, or really the desire to spend most of our time travelling the world but we are able to visit our friends and family alot more often than when we worked, including those abroad. So at last I am finally mastering another language and have a chance to use it.

Imagine that I am 60? Hmm. Who knows what I will be doing in 9 or 10 years time. I suppose it's not unreasonable to imagine that I will be doing the same thing that I am doing now. My health is OK. I rarely go to the Doctors. Home life is OK, I am co-habiting with a girl called [NAME] who is 13 years my junior. We get on very well together. I am on the Committee of my Local Working Men's Club, which takes up a fair bit of my spare time. With that and often doing little jobs or favours for other people, I often find it difficult to find the time for things that I want to do. Such as: Rebuilding my motorbike or practicing the guitar which I am going to evening classes for. I may well have a rest from the Club committee this year as there are thing that I really want to get going on. Sorting out peoples computer problems is another thing I'm often asked to do. Why can't everyone just buy a Macintosh, then there would be no problems. Never mind, first beer festival of the year in a couple of weeks, happy days.

WE ARE NOT WELL OFF BUT COMFORTABLE AND FEEL SECURE IN OUR SURROUNDINGS AND RELATIONSHIP. MY ASTHMA HAS NOT WORSENED WITH MY AGE AND I CONTINUE TO BE FIT AND ACTIVE. I HAVE MORE TIME TO INDULGE MY HOBBIES AND LOOK FORWARD TO RETIRING AND TAKING A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN COMMUNITY LIFE. I'M HOPING THAT THIS PERIOD WILL SEE ME DEVELOP BETTER SOCIAL AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS AND AS A PERSONAL TARGET ACHIEVE THE DEGREE I'VE ALWAYS WANTED BUT FORSAKE AT 16 YR OLD TO GET WORK AND HELP THE FAMILY

I have now been retired (no, not retired, I am now a gentleman of leisure, sounds much better) for five years now, and I don't think I've ever been fitter. I'm cycling two or three times a week, 60-70 miles at a time, plus holidays in Britain and abroad, so I'm covering about 10,000 miles a year! I'm also finding plenty of time to indulge my other hobbies and pastimes, including astronomy and building my own hi-fi equipment, amplifier and speakers mostly. I certainly don't have time to work for a living, something I always considered to be a mugs game anyway. Don't know why I didn't pack it in sooner.

I will be retired from my job as a teacher, but still expect to do some supply work in local schools, when I feel like it or perhaps tutor students A/GCSE level. My job has meant that I have spent my hours at home preparing and marking work, I will enjoy the free time to be even more active, walking, swimming etc and relaxing. I can see my wife and I taking extended vacations - winter months in the med, enjoying the climate, walking etc perhaps going to different parts of Greece etc every year. I feel that I should give something back to society and undertake voluntary work with disadvantaged children or similar groups. I expect my health to still be good and not hinder me in doing what I want to do.

Observation ID: N18536Y
I don't know what I'll be doing when I am 60, as I don’t plan ahead. If I make plans they always seem to go wrong. So long as I am healthy + still alive, I would be happy. I tend to adapt to which ever situation I happen to be in. I am a great believer in destiny + fate and take whatever life throws at me. I enjoy solving problems + helping people. I enjoy working when I have a job and tend not to worry too much about anything. I enjoy watching wildlife + nature programmes on T.V. Am also interested in the Environment polotics and world News. If I am able to help somebody I get great satisfaction from this. A lot of people tend to take advantage of my Good Nature as I find it hard to say NO to people, putting other before myself. I could have done a lot more in my life but lack ambition things that seem important to you are not as important to me. All in all I have a good life even with all the ups + DOWNS. I wouldn't change it even if I could. Thanks

Observation ID: N23274E
At 60 I would like to be working full-time or a good percentage of the week. Both my children will have left home so I hope to have more time to pursue other interests such as singing and playing clarinet (both have been past activities) and to travel both short distance, eg weekends away and further afield. I envisage my health will be better than average that I will continue to walk my dog, pursue pilates classes (as I do now) and other physical activities. At home I would like to have friends & relatives to stay at regular intervals, I would hope to see my children and their partners on a reasonably regular basis. I envisage that I will still be married to my husband and I hope that we are still enjoying sailing and other activities together.

Observation ID: N16313B
I hope that I will still be relatively healthy and enjoying life, but equally I recognised that I may well be dead. I hope thay I will still be working steadily and enjoying my work. I expect that I will still need to work to fund my life as I'm sure that I will need the money. Hopefully I will still be married to my beloved wife {WIFE}, and I really really really hope that her health will not have deteriorated. I might even have finished renovating the house. I doubt very much that I will still be able to ride my motorbike, even with two hip replacements.

I expect I will be working although I would rather not be - personally I feel that there are too many things I want to do but I've got to pay off the mortgage and help both my children get through university and start their own lives on this very unfair financial playground. I need time to think things through and to spend time with the people I love - read, play music, talk to people. There are always worthwhile issues to get involved with and loads of knowledge to acquire - I hope I'm in the university of the 3rd age + doing lots of travel but I expect I'll be working. Healthwise who knows!!

I am still a teacher with 5 years to go to retirement - I am finding the job more & more stressful but cannot retire early due to financial reasons. I continue to sleep my grandchildren most weekends (may have more now) which is special but exhausting - one has autism. I continue to be unable to afford a holiday, haven't had one is twenty years but my dogs and goats are a good substitute. My relationship with my partner continues to be O.K. we do not spend very much time together due to working long hours - but we don't argue either. I have anaemia, depression and a stomach ulser I hope don't get any worse.

Observation ID: N25152D
Hope to have retired from full time work, possibly doing my own thing as a part time job, so self employed. Hope my children have found their feet in their chosen careers and we're not still suporting them too heavily.@Given some more of our own time wish to be doing more active things, walking etc, and spending even longer in the garden. Mortgage will be paid off and pensions should start to kick in so should have a reasonable income still as well as doing whatever I can part time.

NOW I HAVE TURNED 60, I HAVE CHANGED MY SPORTING INTERESTS FROM PLAYING TO WATCHING. I STILL GO TO CELTIC PARK EVERY SECOND SATURDAY. BUT UNFORTUNATELY AS MOST OF MY BADMINTON PLAYING FRIENDS HAVE RETIRED OR PASSED AWAY MY CLUB HAS STOPPED. I AM, HOWEVER CONSIDERING TAKING UP BOWLES? I AM STILL MARRIED & IN LOVE, AND ENJOY THE COMPANY OF MY CHILDREN & THEIR CHILDREN. THE SAD THING IS THE AMOUNT OF FUNERAL'S I ATTEND AS MY AUNTS & UNCLES ARE REACHING THE END OF THEIR LIVES. I AM STILL IN CHILD-CARE & I HAVE OBTAINED A MANAGER'S POSITION & I STILL DO A LITTLE DRIVING INSTRUCTION. MY HEALTH IS MUCH THE SAME, BUT I CANNOT TAKE PART IN SPORT AS I AM SLOWER & TEND TO TAKE MORE TIME TO RECOVER. I CAN SEE RETIREMENT COMING IN 5 YEARS.

I will be living in the same house that I live in now. I will either be retired or working part time (around 15-20 hrs per week) for myself from home. Probably selling on Ebay. I will not receive a state pension until the age of 63, but I will have enough savings to cover me until I receive a pension. I hope to be in good health. My husband will be retired and we will have 2-3 holidays per year and weekends away. We may take a longer winter holiday abroad for a month or longer. My hobbies will be digital photography and spending more time in the garden. I will have one or two Grandchildren to take out and look after.

Observation ID: N14334Y
I would expect that I would still need to be in fulltime employment, and hopefully working for the same company as today. I would not expect early retirement to have been an option for me in my late fifties. I will still be very happily married, and my wife and I in reasonable health, although the general aches and pains associated with growing older will be more apparent. We will still have an enjoyable and active sex life. Hopefully the grieving process for my wife and I, from losing all our parents within three years in our late forties will be behind us. At 60 we will hopefully be free from our mortgage, and still taking regular weekly and fortnightly holidays in the UK, and short city breaks in Europe. DIY activities on the house will be at a minimum, but we will still be working regularly in the garden. The occasional walk, bird watching trip or picnic will happen now and then and perhaps the odd round of golf, Christmas when 60 will mean one of our five year christmas away from home trips will be on the agenda. I will, I guess, be reflecting on my life, and preparing for retirement, with perhaps considering possible early retirement or retiring to the USA. In conclusion, I see life a 60 much as it is now a 50. However, with a little less energy and more troubles from the aging process and less need for drive and ambition.

I'm hopefully still working in the wine trade - which I love - & my Mortgage will be paid off leaving me a lot better off & able to afford to go off for weekends, to the places I would still love to visit, & to generally do things I couldn't really afford before. I'll be eating out with my friends on a regular basis - going to the the cinema, the theatre & generally enjoying life! I may be physically more restricted in what I can actually do but I'll give everything a good try!

In 10 years time I shall be dedicated to my work so I imagine that my home life will remain a little solitary. My children will be grown and making deep inroads into their respective careers & lifes. Economically I would expect the Country to still be in poor shape which will have an impact on my own financial well-being. I imagine that I will need to work at least until I'm 65 prior to retiring - and then only on a modest income. I see few opportunities to alight from the tread-mill and I worry therefore that my health will suffer as one puts in considerable hours & take inadequate recreation. PERSONAL (29/12/08)

I am looking forward to the menopause being over and would like to be in a long term committed relationship with a man, but - I enjoy my freedom and independance so may be I will not!

At 60 I would hope that my 2 children will be in steady and stable relationships an also be in regular employment. If this is the case I will not have to support them financially an in other ways as to the level I do now. This will allow me the time to persue my interests of dog showing and horse riding which I do not have time for at present. I hope to have stopped smoking and therefore reap the benefits healthwise. With regards to work I would consider early retirement if it was financially feasible but in reality I think that I will still be working full time.

At 60 years old I am enjoying more free time. I work 2 days a week which gives me some pocket money and an interest. My sons have left home and are working and enjoying life. My husband,{HUSBAND} and I like to travel and explore new places both here and abroad. It is good to have the time together again after bringing up a family and working full time for a long time. I exercise as much as possible, attending the local sports centre and going on long walks. This helps my general health and well-being. My back and neck will always be a problem, but I am much better since working less and exercising more.

Observation ID: N23311S
Unfortunately it is more difficult these days (especially in this economic climate) to be able to predict with any confidence what we may be engaged in & how we may be placed in 10 years time. By contrast our parents would have planned when to retire and had an idea of their financial situation & security. Life is far more unpredictable. I would like to think that I might be in a position to retire but our future will depend largely on my husband's employment and the next 10-15 years. If he is unable to retire I am sure our lives will remain unchanged albeit that the children will be more independent! Also health will be a factor - and an unknown one. I wish I had a crystal ball! All I can say is I would hope I will always be able to carry on working in some capacity whether this be part-time paid or voluntary work and to enjoy any spare time with my husband, children and maybe grandchildren. Is that enough? PERSONAL

At 60 I'm still married and working in the Arts. Although my husband and I remain Directors of our company we work on separate projects - I work primarily supporting young people. We still live in the same cottage although we are seriously looking to down size - one main reason for this is that most of our capital is tied up in the property. Deciding where to move to is a difficult decision to make. We are also grandparents - or rather I'm a step-grandmother. My health is reasonable and I try to keep fit by walking our 2 dogs twice a day. I've also started to do my own artwork again - mainly for my own pleasure but I hope to also sell my work. My husband's arthritis has improved with the new drugs, although sometimes it stops him doing what he'd like to. I feel content most of the time but hate the wrinkles.

I may still be at work as I enjoy what I am doing and we have staff over pension age. I will hopefully have more time to spend with my husband. Maybe I will be a grandparent, that would be nice. I may have moved to a smaller house or bungalow - more a decision for me and my husband and not because of schools.

We now make far more use of days out at National Trust properties, which we were always going to do years ago, but now there's more time, and less money for more expensive outings. My interests are still much the same, walking (now with our dog), doing puzzles (sudoku, etc.), cooking, reading and TV. We both go to the local theatre a bit more now that John hasn't got such an early start in the morning, and we make a point of not getting up so early now. I am happy, and content with my life, and am still doing some voluntary work, bot through the church, and with local young people. I am still, or have only recently given up, being a magistrate, something I first considered about 10 years ago. Health-wise, I'm ok, not very fit, but apart form the odd ache and pain, I'm fine.

I enjoy walking at week ends, going out for meals with family or friends. I look forward to spending time with grandchildren. Stiff and aching joints get me down and slow me down somedays but I won't let it stop me from enjoying life. I still work fulltime it keeps me fit and gives me a well rounded feeling of well-being.

Being 60 means getting a bus pass, which you can travel all over Scotland so it opens the doors for lots of things ie time to yourself, travel. Hopefully still being in good health & still working wether it be paid employment or voluntary. I would like to think I would have more time for interests of my own.

Well I am still alive. My job is OK, I am mortgage free so that has made it alot easier. My condition has got worse as they said it would. My ICD is still working correctly. I am enjoying my exercise on the Wii. My girls are grown. I am enjoying my grandchildren they keep me fit. I am just plodding along. {WIFE} is keeping me on the right track as usual.

Reaching 60 has now given me the chance to retire with my wife and do a lot of the things that we did not have much time for. My health enables me to go walking and birdwatching.
